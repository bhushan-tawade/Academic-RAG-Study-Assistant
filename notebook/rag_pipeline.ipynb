Introduction \\n \\n1.1 What Is Machine Learning?  \\nMachine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example \\ndata or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the \\nexecution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or \\npast experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain \\nknowledge from data, or both. \\nArthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, \\ncoined the term “Machine Learning” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field of \\nstudy that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” However, there is \\nno universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently. \\n \\nDefinition of learning \\nDefinition \\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and \\nperformance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \\n \\nExamples \\ni) Handwriting recognition learning problem \\n• Task T: Recognising and classifying handwritten words within images \\n• Performance P: Percent of words correctly classified \\n• Training experience E: A dataset of handwritten words with given classifications \\nii) A robot driving learning problem \\n• Task T: Driving on highways using vision sensors \\n• Performance measure P: Average distance traveled before an error \\n• training experience: A sequence of images and steering commands recorded while  \\n  observing a human driver \\niii) A chess learning problem \\n• Task T: Playing chess \\n• Performance measure P: Percent of games won against opponents \\n• Training experience E: Playing practice games against itself \\nDefinition \\nA computer program which learns from experience is called a machine learning program or \\nsimply a learning program. Such a program is sometimes also referred to as a learner. \\n \\n1.2 Components of Learning \\n Basic components of learning process \\nThe learning process, whether by a human or a machine, can be divided into four components, \\nnamely, data storage, abstraction, generalization and evaluation. Figure 1.1 illustrates the \\nvariouscomponents and the steps involved in the learning process.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Chapter 1 - Intro to ML.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Chapter 1 - Intro to ML.pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 6}, page_content='2 \\n \\n \\n1. Data storage \\nFacilities for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data are an important component of the \\nlearning process. Humans and computers alike utilize data storage as a foundation for advanced \\nreasoning. \\n• In a human being, the data is stored in the brain and data is retrieved using electrochemical    signals. \\n• Computers use hard disk drives, flash memory, random access memory and similar devices    to store \\ndata and use cables and other technology to retrieve data. \\n \\n2. Abstraction \\nThe second component of the learning process is known as abstraction. \\nAbstraction is the process of extracting knowledge about stored data. This involves creating general \\nconcepts about the data as a whole. The creation of knowledge involves application of known models \\nand creation of new models. \\nThe process of fitting a model to a dataset is known as training. When the model has been trained, the \\ndata is transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the original information. \\n \\n3. Generalization \\nThe third component of the learning process is known as generalisation. \\nThe term generalization describes the process of turning the knowledge about stored data into a form \\nthat can be utilized for future action. These actions are to be carried out on tasks that are similar, but \\nnot identical, to those what have been seen before. In generalization, the goal is to discover those \\nproperties of the data that will be most relevant to future tasks. \\n \\n4. Evaluation \\nEvaluation is the last component of the learning process. \\nIt is the process of giving feedback to the user to measure the utility of the learned knowledge. This \\nfeedback is then utilised to effect improvements in the whole learning process \\n \\nApplications of machine learning \\nApplication of machine learning methods to large databases is called data mining. In data \\nmining, a large volume of data is processed to construct a simple model with valuable use, for example, \\nhaving \\nhigh predictive accuracy. \\n \\nThe following is a list of some of the typical applications of machine learning. \\n1. In retail business, machine learning is used to study consumer behaviour. \\n2.

The basic idea of Learning models has divided into three categories. \\nFor a given problem, the collection of all possible outcomes represents the sample space or instance \\nspace. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing a Logical expression. (Logical models) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing the Geometry of the instance space. (Geometric models)  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing Probability to classify the instance space. (Probabilistic models) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGrouping and Grading \\n \\n1.3.1  Logical models \\nLogical models use a logical expression to divide the instance space into segments and hence \\nconstruct grouping models. A logical expression is an expression that returns a Boolean value, i.e., a \\nTrue or False outcome. Once the data is grouped using a logical expression, the data is divided into \\nhomogeneous groupings for the problem we are trying to solve.  For example, for a classiﬁcation \\nproblem, all the instances in the group belong to one class. \\n \\nThere are mainly two kinds of logical models: Tree models and Rule models. \\n \\nRule models consist of a collection of implications or IF-THEN rules. For tree-based models, the ‘if-part’ \\ndeﬁnes a segment and the ‘then-part’ deﬁnes the behaviour of the model for this segment. Rule models \\nfollow the same reasoning. \\n \\nLogical models and Concept learning \\nTo understand logical models further, we need to understand the idea of Concept Learning. \\nConcept Learning involves learning logical expressions or concepts from examples. The idea of Concept \\nLearning fits in well with the idea of Machine learning, i.e., inferring a general function from specific \\ntraining examples. Concept learning forms the basis of both tree-based and rule-based models.  More \\nformally, Concept Learning involves acquiring the definition of a general category from a given set of \\npositive and negative training examples of the category. A Formal Definition for Concept Learning is \\n“The inferring of a Boolean-valued function from training examples of its input and output.” In \\nconcept learning, we only learn a description for the positive class and label everything that doesn’t \\nsatisfy that description as negative.'),\n",

Each data is described by six attributes. The task is to learn to predict the value of \\nEnjoy Sport for an arbitrary day based on the values of its attribute values. The problem can be \\nrepresented by a series of hypotheses. Each hypothesis is described by a conjunction of constraints on \\nthe attributes. The training data represents a set of positive and negative examples of the target \\nfunction. In the example above, each hypothesis is a vector of six constraints, specifying the values of \\nthe six attributes –  Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The training phase involves \\nlearning the set of days (as a conjunction of attributes) for which Enjoy Sport = yes. \\n \\nThus, the problem can be formulated as: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGiven instances X  which represent a set of all possible days, each described by the attributes: \\no \\nSky – (values: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy), \\no \\nAirTemp – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no \\nHumidity – (values: Normal, High), \\no \\nWind – (values: Strong, Weak), \\no \\nWater – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no \\nForecast – (values: Same, Change). \\n \\nTry to identify a function that can predict the target variable Enjoy Sport as yes/no, i.e., 1 or 0. \\n \\n1.3.2 Geometric models \\nIn the previous section, we have seen that with logical models, such as decision trees, a logical \\nexpression is used to partition the instance space. Two instances are similar when they end up in the \\nsame logical segment. In this section, we consider models that define similarity by considering the \\ngeometry of the instance space.  In Geometric models, features could be described as points in two \\ndimensions (x- and y-axis) or a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z). Even when features are not'),\n",

In geometric models, there are two ways we could \\nimpose similarity. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWe could use geometric concepts like lines or planes to segment (classify) the instance space. \\nThese are called Linear models. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAlternatively, we can use the geometric notion of distance to represent similarity. In this case, if \\ntwo points are close together, they have similar values for features and thus can be classed as \\nsimilar. We call such models as Distance-based models. \\n \\n \\nLinear models \\nLinear models are relatively simple. In this case, the function is represented as a linear \\ncombination of its inputs. Thus, if x1 and x2 are two scalars or vectors of the same dimension \\nand a and b are arbitrary scalars, then ax1 + bx2 represents a linear combination of x1 and x2. In the \\nsimplest case where f(x) represents a straight line, we have an equation of the form f (x) \\n= mx + c where c represents the intercept and m represents the slope. \\n \\n \\nLinear models are parametric, which means that they have a ﬁxed form with a small number of numeric \\nparameters that need to be learned from data. For example, in f (x) = mx + c, m and c are the \\nparameters that we are trying to learn from the data. This technique is different from tree or rule \\nmodels, where the structure of the model (e.g., which features to use in the tree, and where) is not \\nﬁxed in advance. \\n \\nLinear models are stable, i.e., small variations in the training data have only a limited impact on the \\nlearned model. In contrast, tree models tend to vary more with the training data, as the choice of a \\ndifferent split at the root of the tree typically means that the rest of the tree is different as well.  As a \\nresult of having relatively few parameters, Linear models have low variance and high bias. This implies \\nthat Linear models are less likely to overfit the training data than some other models. However, they \\nare more likely to underfit. For example, if we want to learn the boundaries between countries based \\non labelled data, then linear models are not likely to give a good approximation. \\n \\nDistance-based models \\nDistance-based models are the second class of Geometric models. Like Linear models, distance-\\nbased models are based on the geometry of data. As the name implies, distance-based models work on \\nthe concept of distance.  In the context of Machine learning, the concept of distance is not based on \\nmerely the physical distance between two points. Instead, we could think of the distance between two \\npoints considering the mode of transport between two points. Travelling between two cities by plane'),\n",

Similarly, in chess, the \\nconcept of distance depends on the piece used – for example, a Bishop can move diagonally.   Thus, \\ndepending on the entity and the mode of travel, the concept of distance can be experienced differently. \\nThe distance metrics commonly used are Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis. \\n \\n \\nDistance is applied through the concept of neighbours and exemplars. Neighbours are points in \\nproximity with respect to the distance measure expressed through exemplars. Exemplars are \\neither centroids that ﬁnd a centre of mass according to a chosen distance metric or medoids that ﬁnd \\nthe most centrally located data point. The most commonly used centroid is the arithmetic mean, which \\nminimises squared Euclidean distance to all other points. \\n \\nNotes: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe centroid represents the geometric centre of a plane figure, i.e., the arithmetic mean \\nposition of all the points in the figure from the centroid point. This definition extends to any \\nobject in n-dimensional space: its centroid is the mean position of all the points. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nMedoids are similar in concept to means or centroids. Medoids are most commonly used on \\ndata when a mean or centroid cannot be defined. They are used in contexts where the centroid \\nis not representative of the dataset, such as in image data. \\n \\nExamples of distance-based models include the nearest-neighbour models, which use the training data \\nas exemplars – for example, in classification. The K-means clustering algorithm also uses exemplars to \\ncreate clusters of similar data points. \\n \\n1.3.3 Probabilistic models \\nThe third family of machine learning algorithms is the probabilistic models. We have seen \\nbefore that the k-nearest neighbour algorithm uses the idea of distance (e.g., Euclidian distance) to \\nclassify entities, and logical models use a logical expression to partition the instance space. In this \\nsection, we see how the probabilistic models use the idea of probability to classify new entities. \\n \\nProbabilistic models see features and target variables as random variables. The process of modelling \\nrepresents and manipulates the level of uncertainty with respect to these variables. There are two \\ntypes of probabilistic models: Predictive and Generative. Predictive probability models use the idea of \\na conditional probability distribution P (Y |X) from which Y can be predicted from X.  Generative models \\nestimate the joint distribution P (Y, X).  Once we know the joint distribution for the generative models, \\nwe can derive any conditional or marginal distribution involving the same variables. Thus, the \\ngenerative model is capable of creating new data points and their labels, knowing the joint probability \\ndistribution. The joint distribution looks for a relationship between two variables. Once this relationship \\nis inferred, it is possible to infer new data points. \\nNaïve Bayes is an example of a probabilistic classifier. \\n \\nWe can do this using the Bayes rule defined as'),\n",

Is the training experience good — Do the training examples represent the distribution of examples \\nover which the final system performance will be measured? Performance is best when training \\nexamples and test examples are from the same/a similar distribution. \\n \\nThe checker player learns by playing against oneself. Its experience is indirect. It may not encounter \\nmoves that are common in human expert play. Once the proper training experience is available, the next \\ndesign step will be choosing the Target Function. \\n \\n1.4.2 Choosing the Target Function \\nWhen you are playing the checkers game, at any moment of time, you make a decision on \\nchoosing the best move from different possibilities. You think and apply the learning that you have \\ngained from the experience. Here the learning is, for a specific board, you move a checker such that your \\nboard state tends towards the winning situation. Now the same learning has to be defined in terms of \\nthe target function. \\n \\nHere there are 2 considerations — direct and indirect experience. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDuring the direct experience, the checkers learning system, it needs only to learn how to choose \\nthe best move among some large search space. We need to find a target function that will help \\nus choose the best move among alternatives. Let us call this function ChooseMove and use the \\nnotation ChooseMove : B →M to indicate that this function accepts as input any board from the \\nset of legal board states B and produces as output some move from the set of legal moves M. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhen there is an indirect experience, it becomes difficult to learn such function. How about \\nassigning a real score to the board state.  \\n \\nSo the function be V : B →R indicating that this accepts as input any board from the set of legal board \\nstates B and produces an output a real score. This function assigns the higher scores to better board \\nstates. \\n \\n \\nIf the system can successfully learn such a target function V, then it can easily use it to select the best \\nmove from any board position.'),\n",

So this \\ndefinition is not efficiently computable by our checkers playing program, we say that it is a \\nnonoperational definition. \\n \\nThe goal of learning, in this case, is to discover an operational description of V ; that is, a description \\nthat can be used by the checkers-playing program to evaluate states and select moves within realistic \\ntime bounds. \\nIt may be very difficult in general to learn such an operational form of V perfectly. We expect learning \\nalgorithms to acquire only some approximation to the target function ^V. \\n \\n1.4.3 Choosing a representation for the Target Function \\nNow that we have specified the ideal target function V, we must choose a representation that \\nthe learning program will use to describe the function ^V that it will learn. As with earlier design \\nchoices, we again have many options. We could, for example, allow the program to represent using a \\nlarge table with a distinct entry specifying the value for each distinct board state. Or we could allow it to \\nrepresent using a collection of rules that match against features of the board state, or a quadratic \\npolynomial function of predefined board features, or an artificial \\nneural network. In general, this choice of representation involves a crucial tradeoff. On one hand, we \\nwish to pick a very expressive representation to allow representing as close an approximation as \\npossible to the ideal target function V.  \\n \\nOn the other hand, the more expressive the representation, the more training data the program \\nwill require in order to choose among the alternative hypotheses it can represent. To keep the \\ndiscussion brief, let us choose a simple representation:  \\nfor any given board state, the function ^V will be calculated as a linear combination of the following \\nboard features: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx1(b) — number of black pieces on board b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx2(b) — number of red pieces on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx3(b) — number of black kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx4(b) — number of red kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx5(b) — number of red pieces threatened by black (i.e., which can be taken on black’s next turn) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx6(b) — number of black pieces threatened by red \\n \\n^V = w0 + w1 · x1(b) + w2 · x2(b) + w3 · x3(b) + w4 · x4(b) +w5 · x5(b) + w6 · x6(b) \\n \\nWhere w0 through w6 are numerical coefficients or weights to be obtained by a learning algorithm.  \\nWeights w1 to w6 will determine the relative importance of different board features.'),\n",

Each training example is an ordered pair <b,V_train(b)> \\nFor example, a training example may be <(x1 = 3, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 0), +100\">. This is an \\nexample where black has won the game since x2 = 0 or red has no remaining pieces. However, such clean \\nvalues of V_train (b) can be obtained only for board value b that are clear win, loss or draw. \\nIn above case, assigning a training value V_train(b) for the specific boards b that are clean win, loss or \\ndraw is direct as they are direct training experience. But in the case of indirect training experience, \\nassigning a training value V_train(b) for the intermediate boards is difficult. In such case, the training \\nvalues are updated using temporal difference learning. Temporal difference (TD) learning is a concept \\ncentral to reinforcement learning, in which learning happens through the iterative correction of your \\nestimated returns towards a more accurate target return. \\nLet Successor(b) denotes the next board state following b for which it is again the program’s turn to \\nmove. ^V is the learner’s current approximation to V. Using these information, assign the training value \\nof V_train(b) for any intermediate board state b as below :  \\nV_train(b) ← ^V(Successor(b)) \\n \\nAdjusting the weights \\nNow its time to define the learning algorithm for choosing the weights and best fit the set of \\ntraining examples. One common approach is to define the best hypothesis as that which minimizes the \\nsquared error E between the training values and the values predicted by the hypothesis ^V. \\n \\n \\nThe learning algorithm should incrementally refine weights as more training examples become available \\nand it needs to be robust to errors in training data Least Mean Square (LMS) training rule is the one \\ntraining algorithm that will adjust weights a small amount in the direction that reduces the error. \\n \\nThe LMS algorithm is defined as follows:'),\n",

Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, the accuracy \\nof the structure that is output by the algorithm cannot be evaluated. The most common unsupervised \\nlearning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns'),\n",

The data consists of the gender \\nand age of the patients. \\n \\nBased on this data, can we infer anything regarding the patients entering the clinic? \\n \\n1.5.3 Reinforcement learning \\nThis is somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning. The algorithm gets told \\nwhen the answer is wrong, but does not get told how to correct it. It has to explore and try out different \\npossibilities until it works out how to get the answer right. Reinforcement learning is sometime called \\nlearning with a critic because of this monitor that scores the answer, but does not suggest \\nimprovements. \\n \\nReinforcement learning is the problem of getting an agent to act in the world so as to maximize \\nits rewards. A learner (the program) is not told what actions to take as in most forms of machine \\nlearning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most \\ninteresting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next \\nsituations and, through that, all subsequent rewards. \\n \\nExample \\nConsider teaching a dog a new trick: we cannot tell it what to do, but we can reward/punish it if \\nit does the right/wrong thing. It has to find out what it did that made it get the reward/punishment. We \\ncan use a similar method to train computers to do many tasks, such as playing backgammon or chess, \\nscheduling jobs, and controlling robot limbs. Reinforcement learning is different from supervised \\nlearning. Supervised learning is learning from examples provided by a knowledgeable expert. \\n \\n1.6 PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING \\n \\nPerspectives in Machine Learning \\nOne useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very large space of \\npossible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by \\nthe learner. \\nFor example, consider the space of hypotheses that could in principle be output by the above checkers \\nlearner. This hypothesis space consists of all evaluation functions that can be represented by some \\nchoice of values for the weights wo through w6. The learner's task is thus to search through this vast \\nspace to locate the hypothesis that is most consistent with the available training examples. The LMS \\nalgorithm for fitting weights achieves this goal by iteratively tuning the weights, adding a correction to \\neach weight each time the hypothesized evaluation function predicts a value that differs from the \\ntraining value. This algorithm works well when the hypothesis representation considered by the learner \\ndefines a continuously parameterized space of potential hypotheses.\"),\n",

These different hypothesis representations are appropriate for learning different \\nkinds of target functions. For each of these hypothesis representations, the corresponding learning \\nalgorithm takes advantage of a different underlying structure to organize the search through the \\nhypothesis space.  \\n \\nThroughout this book we will return to this perspective of learning as a search problem in order \\nto characterize learning methods by their search strategies and by the underlying structure of the \\nsearch spaces they explore. We will also find this viewpoint useful in formally analyzing the relationship \\nbetween the size of the hypothesis space to be searched, the number of training examples available, \\nand the confidence we can have that a hypothesis consistent with the training data will correctly \\ngeneralize to unseen examples. \\n \\nIssues in Machine Learning \\nOur checkers example raises a number of generic questions about machine learning.

And the leaves, which are outcomes like either ‘fit’, or ‘unfit’. In this case this was a binary \\nclassification problem (a yes no type problem). There are two main types of Decision Trees: \\n1. Classification trees (Yes/No types) \\nWhat we have seen above is an example of classification tree, where the outcome was a variable like \\n‘fit’ or ‘unfit’. Here the decision variable is Categorical. \\n \\n2. Regression trees (Continuous data types) \\nHere the decision or the outcome variable is Continuous, e.g. a number like 123.  Working Now that we \\nknow what a Decision Tree is, we’ll see how it works internally. There are many algorithms out there \\nwhich construct Decision Trees, but one of the best is called as ID3 Algorithm. ID3 Stands for Iterative \\nDichotomiser 3. Before discussing the ID3 algorithm, we’ll go through few definitions. Entropy Entropy, \\nalso called as Shannon Entropy is denoted by H(S) for a finite set S, is the measure of the amount of \\nuncertainty or randomness in data. \\n \\nIntuitively, it tells us about the predictability of a certain event. Example, consider a coin toss whose \\nprobability of heads is 0.5 and probability of tails is 0.5. Here the entropy is the highest possible, since \\nthere’s no way of determining what the outcome might be. Alternatively, consider a coin which has \\nheads on both the sides, the entropy of such an event can be predicted perfectly since we know \\nbeforehand that it’ll always be heads. In other words, this event has no randomness hence it’s entropy \\nis zero. In particular, lower values imply less uncertainty while higher values imply high \\nuncertainty.

Classification Trees \\nA classification tree is an algorithm where the target variable is fixed or categorical. The \\nalgorithm is then used to identify the “class” within which a target variable would most likely fall. \\nAn example of a classification-type problem would be determining who will or will not subscribe to a \\ndigital platform; or who will or will not graduate from high school. \\nThese are examples of simple binary classifications where the categorical dependent variable can \\nassume only one of two, mutually exclusive values. In other cases, you might have to predict among a \\nnumber of different variables. For instance, you may have to predict which type of smartphone a \\nconsumer may decide to purchase. \\nIn such cases, there are multiple values for the categorical dependent variable. Here’s what a classic \\nclassification tree looks like'),\n",

Regression Trees \\nA regression tree refers to an algorithm where the target variable is and the algorithm is used to \\npredict it’s value. As an example of a regression type problem, you may want to predict the selling \\nprices of a residential house, which is a continuous dependent variable. \\nThis will depend on both continuous factors like square footage as well as categorical factors like the \\nstyle of home, area in which the property is located and so on. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen to use Classification and Regression Trees \\nClassification trees are used when the dataset needs to be split into classes which belong to the \\nresponse variable. In many cases, the classes Yes or No. \\nIn other words, they are just two and mutually exclusive. In some cases, there may be more than two \\nclasses in which case a variant of the classification tree algorithm is used. \\nRegression trees, on the other hand, are used when the response variable is continuous. For instance, if \\nthe response variable is something like the price of a property or the temperature of the day, a \\nregression tree is used. \\nIn other words, regression trees are used for prediction-type problems while classification trees are \\nused for classification-type problems. \\n \\nHow Classification and Regression Trees Work \\nA classification tree splits the dataset based on the homogeneity of data. Say, for instance, \\nthere are two variables; income and age; which determine whether or not a consumer will buy a \\nparticular kind of phone. \\nIf the training data shows that 95% of people who are older than 30 bought the phone, the data gets \\nsplit there and age becomes a top node in the tree. This split makes the data “95% pure”. Measures of \\nimpurity like entropy or Gini index are used to quantify the homogeneity of the data when it comes to \\nclassification trees.'),\n",

After this, the data is split at several points for each independent variable. \\nAt each such point, the error between the predicted values and actual values is squared to get “A Sum \\nof Squared Errors” (SSE). The SSE is compared across the variables and the variable or point which has \\nthe lowest SSE is chosen as the split point. This process is continued recursively. \\n \\n \\nAdvantages of Classification and Regression Trees \\nThe purpose of the analysis conducted by any classification or regression tree is to create a set of if-else \\nconditions that allow for the accurate prediction or classification of a case. \\n(i) The Results are Simplistic \\nThe interpretation of results summarized in classification or regression trees is usually fairly simple. The \\nsimplicity of results helps in the following ways. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt allows for the rapid classification of new observations. That’s because it is much simpler to \\nevaluate just one or two logical conditions than to compute scores using complex nonlinear \\nequations for each group. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt can often result in a simpler model which explains why the observations are either classified \\nor predicted in a certain way. For instance, business problems are much easier to explain with \\nif-then statements than with complex nonlinear equations. \\n(ii) Classification and Regression Trees are Nonparametric & Nonlinear \\nThe results from classification and regression trees can be summarized in simplistic if-then conditions. \\nThis negates the need for the following implicit assumptions. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable are linear. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable follow some specific nonlinear link function. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable are monotonic. \\nSince there is no need for such implicit assumptions, classification and regression tree methods are well \\nsuited to data mining. This is because there is very little knowledge or assumptions that can be made \\nbeforehand about how the different variables are related. \\nAs a result, classification and regression trees can actually reveal relationships between these variables \\nthat would not have been possible using other techniques. \\n(iii) Classification and Regression Trees Implicitly Perform Feature Selection \\nFeature selection or variable screening is an important part of analytics. When we use decision trees, \\nthe top few nodes on which the tree is split are the most important variables within the set. As a result, \\nfeature selection gets performed automatically and we don’t need to do it again. \\nLimitations of Classification and Regression Trees'),\n",

This is a testament to the popularity of these decision trees and how frequently they are \\nused. However, these decision trees are not without their disadvantages. \\nThere are many classification and regression trees examples where the use of a decision tree has not \\nled to the optimal result. Here are some of the limitations of classification and regression trees. \\n(i) Overfitting \\nOverfitting occurs when the tree takes into account a lot of noise that exists in the data and \\ncomes up with an inaccurate result. \\n(ii) High variance \\nIn this case, a small variance in the data can lead to a very high variance in the prediction, \\nthereby affecting the stability of the outcome. \\n(iii) Low bias \\nA decision tree that is very complex usually has a low bias. This makes it very difficult for the \\nmodel to incorporate any new data. \\n \\nWhat is a CART in Machine Learning? \\nA Classification and Regression Tree (CART) is a predictive algorithm used in machine learning. It \\nexplains how a target variable’s values can be predicted based on other values. \\nIt is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a \\nprediction for the target variable. \\nThe CART algorithm is an important decision tree algorithm that lies at the foundation of machine \\nlearning. Moreover, it is also the basis for other powerful machine learning algorithms like bagged \\ndecision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees. \\nSumming up \\nThe Classification and regression tree (CART) methodology is one of the oldest and most fundamental \\nalgorithms. It is used to predict outcomes based on certain predictor variables. \\nThey are excellent for data mining tasks because they require very little data pre-processing. Decision \\ntree models are easy to understand and implement which gives them a strong advantage when \\ncompared to other analytical models. \\n \\n2.2. Regression \\nRegression Analysis in Machine learning \\nRegression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent \\n(target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More \\nspecifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is \\nchanging corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It \\npredicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc. \\n \\nWe can understand the concept of regression analysis using the below example: \\n \\nExample: Suppose there is a marketing company A, who does various advertisement every year and get \\nsales on that. The below list shows the advertisement made by the company in the last 5 years and the \\ncorresponding sales:'),\n",

So to solve such type of prediction problems in machine \\nlearning, we need regression analysis. \\nRegression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation between variables \\nand enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one or more predictor variables. \\nIt is mainly used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect \\nrelationship between variables. \\nIn Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fits the given datapoints, using this \\nplot, the machine learning model can make predictions about the data. In simple words, \"Regression \\nshows a line or curve that passes through all the datapoints on target-predictor graph in such a way \\nthat the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum.\" The distance \\nbetween datapoints and line tells whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not. \\n \\nSome examples of regression can be as: \\no \\nPrediction of rain using temperature and other factors \\no \\nDetermining Market trends \\no \\nPrediction of road accidents due to rash driving. \\n \\nTerminologies Related to the Regression Analysis: \\no \\nDependent Variable: The main factor in Regression analysis which we want to predict or \\nunderstand is called the dependent variable. It is also called target variable. \\no \\nIndependent Variable: The factors which affect the dependent variables or which are used to \\npredict the values of the dependent variables are called independent variable, also called as \\na predictor. \\no \\nOutliers: Outlier is an observation which contains either very low value or very high value in \\ncomparison to other observed values. An outlier may hamper the result, so it should be \\navoided. \\no \\nMulticollinearity: If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other than other \\nvariables, then such condition is called Multicollinearity. It should not be present in the dataset, \\nbecause it creates problem while ranking the most affecting variable. \\no \\nUnderfitting and Overfitting: If our algorithm works well with the training dataset but not well \\nwith test dataset, then such problem is called Overfitting. And if our algorithm does not \\nperform well even with training dataset, then such problem is called underfitting.'),\n",

The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or \\na sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression. \\nThe key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. \\nHowever, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values. \\nSimple Linear regression algorithm has mainly two objectives: \\no \\nModel the relationship between the two variables.

Positive examples are indicated by \"+\", negative by \"-\". The inputs are fed to multiple \\nunits, and the outputs of these units are then input to a second, final stage. One way is to represent the \\nBoolean function in disjunctive normal form (i.e., as the disjunction (OR) of a set of conjunctions (ANDs) \\nof the inputs and their negations). Note that the input to an AND perceptron can be negated simply by \\nchanging the sign of the corresponding input weight. Because networks of threshold units can represent \\na rich variety of functions and because single units alone cannot, we will generally be interested in \\nlearning multilayer networks of threshold units. \\n \\nThe Perceptron Training Rule \\nAlthough we are interested in learning networks of many interconnected units, let us begin by \\nunderstanding how to learn the weights for a single perceptron. Here the precise learning problem is to \\ndetermine a weight vector that causes the perceptron to produce the correct 1\\n\\uf0b1 output for each of the \\ngiven training examples. \\nSeveral algorithms are known to solve this learning problem. Here we consider two: the \\nperceptron rule and the delta rule. These two algorithms are guaranteed to converge to somewhat \\ndifferent acceptable hypotheses, under somewhat different conditions. They are important to ANNs \\nbecause they provide the basis for learning networks of many units. \\nOne way to learn an acceptable weight vector is to begin with random weights, then iteratively \\napply the perceptron to each training example, modifying the perceptron weights whenever it \\nmisclassifies an example. This process is repeated, iterating through the training examples as many \\ntimes as needed until \\nthe perceptron classifies all training examples correctly.

The role of the learning rate is to \\nmoderate the degree to which weights are changed at each step. It is usually set to some small value \\n(e.g., 0.1) and is sometimes made to decay as the number of weight-tuning iterations increases. \\nWhy should this update rule converge toward successful weight values? To get an intuitive feel, \\nconsider some specific cases. Suppose the training example is correctly classified already by the \\nperceptron. In this case, (t - o) is zero, making wi\\n\\uf044\\n zero, so that no weights are updated. Suppose the \\nperceptron outputs a -1, when the target output is +1. To make the perceptron output a+1 instead of -1 \\nin this case, the weights must be altered to increase the value of \\n\\uf0ae\\n\\uf0ae\\nx\\nw.\\n For example, if xi>0, then \\nincreasing wi will bring the perceptron closer to correctly classifying this example. Notice the training \\nrule will increase w, in this case, because (t - o),\\uf068, and xi are all positive. For example, if xi = .8, \\uf068 = 0.1, \\nt = 1, and o = - 1, then the weight update will be wi\\n\\uf044\\n = \\uf068 (t - o)xi = O.1(1 - (-1))0.8 = 0.16. On the \\nother hand, if t = -1 and o = 1, then weights associated with positive xi will be decreased rather than \\nincreased. \\n \\nIn fact, the above learning procedure can be proven to converge within a finite number of applications \\nof the perceptron training rule to a weight vector that correctly classifies all training examples, provided \\nthe training examples are linearly separable and provided a sufficiently small \\uf068 is used. If the data are \\nnot linearly separable, convergence is not assured. \\n \\nGradient Descent and the Delta Rule \\nAlthough the perceptron rule finds a successful weight vector when the training examples are \\nlinearly separable, it can fail to converge if the examples are not linearly separable. A second training \\nrule, called the delta rule, is designed to overcome this difficulty. If the training examples are not \\nlinearly separable, the delta rule converges toward a best-fit approximation to the target concept. The \\nkey idea behind the delta rule is to use gradient descent to search the hypothesis space of possible \\nweight vectors to find the weights that best fit the training examples. This rule is important because \\ngradient descent provides the basis for the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm, which can learn networks \\nwith many interconnected units. It is also important because gradient descent can serve as the basis for \\nlearning algorithms that must search through hypothesis spaces containing many different types of \\ncontinuously parameterized hypotheses.  \\nThe delta training rule is best understood by considering the task of training an unthresholded \\nperceptron; that is, a linear unit for which the output o is given by \\n \\n \\n \\nThus, a linear unit corresponds to the first stage of a perceptron, without the threshold. \\nIn order to derive a weight learning rule for linear units, let us begin by specifying a measure for the \\ntraining error of a hypothesis (weight vector), relative to the training examples. Although there are \\nmany ways to define this error, one common measure that will turn out to be especially convenient is \\n \\nwhere D is the set of training examples, td is the target output for training example d, and od is the \\noutput of the linear unit for training example d.

So as support vector creates a decision \\nboundary between these two data (cat and dog) and choose extreme cases (support vectors), it will see \\nthe extreme case of cat and dog.

With \\nthe product rule, each learner has veto power; regardless of the other ones, if one learner has an \\noutput of 0, the overall output goes to 0. Note that after the combination rules, yi do not necessarily \\nsum up to 1. \\n \\nTable 2: Example of combination rules on three learners and three classes \\n \\nIn weighted sum, dji is the vote of learner j for class Ci and wj is the weight of its vote. Simple voting is a \\nspecial case where all voters have equal weight, namely, wj = 1/L. In classification, this is called plurality \\nvoting where the class having the maximum number of votes is the winner. \\n \\nWhen there are two classes, this is majority voting where the winning class gets more than half of the \\nvotes. If the voters can also supply the additional information of how much they vote for each class \\n(e.g., by the posterior probability), then after normalization, these can be used as weights in a weighted \\nvoting scheme.

The idea is that the original task of \\nseparating one class from all other classes may be a difficult problem. Instead, we want to define a set \\nof simpler classification problems, each specializing in one aspect of the task, and combining these \\nsimpler classifiers, we get the final classifier. \\n \\nBase-learners are binary classifiers having output −1/ + 1, and there is a code matrix W of K × L whose K \\nrows are the binary codes of classes in terms of the L base-learners dj. For example, if the second row of \\nW is [−1,+1,+1,−1], this means that for us to say an instance belongs to C2, the instance should be on the \\nnegative side of d1 and d4, and on the positive side of d2 and d3. Similarly, the columns of the code \\nmatrix defines the task of the base-learners. For example, if the third column is [−1,+1,+1]T , we \\nunderstand that the task of the third base-learner, d3, is to separate the instances of C1 from the \\ninstances of C2 and C3 combined. This is how we form the training set of the base-learners. For example \\nin this case, all instances labeled with C2 and C3 form X+\\n3 and instances labeled with C1 form X−\\n3, and d3 is \\ntrained so that xt ∈ X+\\n3 give output +1 and xt ∈ X−\\n3 give output −1. \\n \\nThe code matrix thus allows us to define a polychotomy (K > 2 classification problem) in terms of \\ndichotomies (K = 2 classification problem), and it is a method that is applicable using any learning'),\n",

For \\nexample, for K = 4, \\n \\n \\nwe have \\n                    \\n \\nThe problem here is that if there is an error with one of the baselearners, there may be a \\nmisclassification because the class code words are so similar. So the approach in error-correcting codes \\nis to have L > K and increase the Hamming distance between the code words. One possibility is pairwise \\nseparation of classes where there is a separate baselearner to separate Ci from Cj, for i < j. In this case, L \\n= K(K − 1)/2 and with K = 4, the code matrix is \\n \\n \\nwhere a 0 entry denotes “don’t care.” That is, d1 is trained to separate C1 from C2 and does not use the \\ntraining instances belonging to the other classes. Similarly, we say that an instance belongs to C2 if d1 = \\n−1 and d4 = d5 = +1, and we do not consider the values of d2, d3, and d6.

With K classes, there are 2(K-1) − 1 \\npossible columns, namely, two-class problems. This is because K bits can be written in 2K different ways \\nand complements (e.g., “0101” and “1010,” from our point of view, define the same discriminant) \\ndividing the possible combinations by 2 and then subtracting 1 because a column of all 0s (or 1s) is \\nuseless.

In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the \\nensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set. As an example, the random \\nforest algorithm combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve very high classification \\naccuracy. \\nThe simplest method of combining classifiers is known as bagging, which stands for bootstrap \\naggregating, the statistical description of the method. This is fine if you know what a bootstrap is, but \\nfairly useless if you don’t. A bootstrap sample is a sample taken from the original dataset with \\nreplacement, so that we may get some data several times and others not at all. The bootstrap sample is \\nthe same size as the original, and lots and lots of these samples are taken: B of them, where B is at least \\n50, and could even be in the thousands. The name bootstrap is more popular in computer science than \\nanywhere else, since there is also a bootstrap loader, which is the first program to run when a computer \\nis turned on. It comes from the nonsensical idea of ‘picking yourself up by your bootstraps,’ which \\nmeans lifting yourself up by your shoelaces, and is meant to imply starting from nothing. \\nBootstrap sampling seems like a very strange thing to do. We’ve taken a perfectly good dataset, \\nmucked it up by sampling from it, which might be good if we had made a smaller dataset (since it would \\nbe faster), but we still ended up with a dataset the same size. Worse, we’ve done it lots of times. Surely \\nthis is just a way to burn up computer time without gaining anything. The benefit of it is that we will get \\nlots of learners that perform slightly differently, which is exactly what we want for an ensemble \\nmethod. Another benefit is that estimates of the accuracy of the classification function can be made \\nwithout complicated analytic work, by throwing computer resources at the problem (technically, \\nbagging is a variance reducing algorithm; the meaning of this will become clearer when we talk about \\nbias and variance). Having taken a set of bootstrap samples, the bagging method simply requires that \\nwe fit a model to each dataset, and then combine them by taking the output to be the majority vote of \\nall the classifiers. A NumPy implementation is shown next, and then we will look at a simple example. \\n \\n# Compute bootstrap samples \\nsamplePoints = np.random.randint(0,nPoints,(nPoints,nSamples)) \\nclassifiers = [] \\n \\nfor i in range(nSamples): \\nsample = [] \\nsampleTarget = [] \\nfor j in range(nPoints): \\nsample.append(data[samplePoints[j,i]])'),\n",

The most interesting thing about a random forest is the \\nways that it creates randomness from a standard dataset. The first of the methods that it uses is the \\none that we have just seen: bagging. If we wish to create a forest then we can make the trees different \\nby training them on slightly different data, so we take bootstrap samples from the dataset for each tree. \\nHowever, this isn’t enough randomness yet. The other obvious place where it is possible to add \\nrandomness is to limit the choices that the decision tree can make. At each node, a random subset of \\nthe features is given to the tree, and it can only pick from that subset rather than from the whole set. \\nAs well as increasing the randomness in the training of each tree, it also speeds up the training, \\nsince there are fewer features to search over at each stage. Of course, it does introduce a new \\nparameter (how many features to consider), but the random forest does not seem to be very sensitive \\nto this parameter; in practice, a subset size that is the square root of the number of features seems to \\nbe common. The effect of these two forms of randomness is to reduce the variance without effecting \\nthe bias. Another benefit of this is that there is no need to prune the trees. There is another parameter \\nthat we don’t know how to choose yet, which is the number of trees to put into the forest. However, \\nthis is fairly easy to pick if we want optimal results: we can keep on building trees until the error stops \\ndecreasing.  \\nOnce the set of trees are trained, the output of the forest is the majority vote for classification, \\nas with the other committee methods that we have seen, or the mean response for regression. And \\nthose are pretty much the main features needed for creating a random forest. The algorithm is given \\nnext before we see some results of using the random forest. \\n \\nAlgorithm \\nHere is an outline of the random forest algorithm. \\n1. The random forests algorithm generates many classification trees. Each tree is generated as \\nfollows: \\na) If the number of examples in the training set is N, take a sample of N examples at \\nrandom - but with replacement, from the original data. This sample will be the training \\nset for generating the tree. \\nb) If there are M input variables, a number m is specified such that at each node, m \\nvariables are selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to'),\n",

The value of m is held constant during the generation of the various \\ntrees in the forest. \\nc) Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. \\n2. To classify a new object from an input vector, put the input vector down each of the trees in the \\nforest. Each tree gives a classification, and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest \\nchooses the classification \\n \\nThe implementation of this is very easy: we modify the decision to take an extra parameter, which is m, \\nthe number of features that should be used in the selection set at each stage. We will look at an \\nexample of using it shortly as a comparison to boosting. \\n \\nLooking at the algorithm you might be able to see that it is a very unusual machine learning \\nmethod because it is embarrassingly parallel: since the trees do not depend upon each other, you can \\nboth create and get decisions from different trees on different individual processors if you have them. \\nThis means that the random forest can run on as many processors as you have available with nearly \\nlinear speedup. \\n \\nThere is one more nice thing to mention about random forests, which is that with a little bit of \\nprogramming effort they come with built-in test data: the bootstrap sample will miss out about 35% of \\nthe data on average, the so-called out-of-bootstrap examples. If we keep track of these datapoints then \\nthey can be used as novel samples for that particular tree, giving an estimated test error that we get \\nwithout having to use any extra datapoints. \\n \\nThis avoids the need for cross-validation. \\n \\nAs a brief example of using the random forest, we start by demonstrating that the random \\nforest gets the correct results on the Party example that has been used in both this and the previous \\nchapters, based on 10 trees, each trained on 7 samples, and with just two levels allowed in each tree: \\n \\n \\n \\nAs a rather more involved example, the car evaluation dataset in the UCI Repository contains 1,728 \\nexamples aiming to classify whether or not a car is a good purchase based on six attributes.

In boosting, we actively try to generate complementary base-learners by training the \\nnext learner on the mistakes of the previous learners. The original boosting algorithm combines three \\nweak learners to generate a strong learner. A weak learner has error probability less than 1/2, which \\nmakes it better than random guessing on a two-class problem, and a strong learner has arbitrarily small \\nerror probability. \\n \\nOriginal Boosting Concept \\nGiven a large training set, we randomly divide it into three. We use X1 and train d1. We then take X2 \\nand feed it to d1. We take all instances misclassified by d1 and also as many instances on which d1 is \\ncorrect \\nfrom X2, and these together form the training set of d2. We then take X3 and feed it to d1 and d2. The \\ninstances on which d1 and d2 disagree form the training set of d3. During testing, given an instance, we \\ngive it to d1 and d2; if they agree, that is the response, otherwise the response of d3 is taken as the \\noutput. \\n \\n1. Split data X into {X1, X2, X3} \\n2. \\nTrain d1 on X1 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTest d1 on X2 \\n3. Train d2 on d1’s mistakes on X2 (plus some right) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTest d1 and d2 on X3 \\n4. Train d3 on disagreements between d1 and d2 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTesting: apply d1 and d2; if disagree, use d3 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nDrawback: need large X \\n \\noverall system has reduced error rate, and the error rate can arbitrarily be reduced by using such \\nsystems recursively, that is, a boosting system of three models used as dj in a higher system. \\n \\nThough it is quite successful, the disadvantage of the original boosting method is that it requires a very \\nlarge training sample. The sample should be divided into three and furthermore, the second and third \\nclassifiers are only trained on a subset on which the previous ones err. So unless one has a quite large \\ntraining set, d2 and d3 will not have training \\nsets of reasonable size. \\n \\n3.5.1AdaBoost \\n         \\nFreund and Schapire (1996) proposed a variant, named AdaBoost, short for adaptive boosting, \\nthat uses the same training set over and over and thus need not be large, but the classifiers should be \\nsimple so that they do not overfit. AdaBoost can also combine an arbitrary number of baselearners, not \\nthree. \\n \\nAdaBoost algorithm'),\n",

Let us say pt\\nj \\ndenotes the probability that the instance pair (xt, rt) is drawn to train the jth base-learner. \\nInitially, all pt\\n1 = 1/N. Then we add new base-learners as follows, starting from j = 1:  Є j denotes the \\nerror rate of dj .  \\nAdaBoost requires that learners are weak, that is,  Є j < 1/2,∀j;  if  not, we stop adding new base-\\nlearners. Note that this error rate is not on the original problem but on the dataset used at step j. We \\ndefine  βj = Є j /(1 −Є j) < 1, and we set pt\\nj+1 = βj pt\\nj if dj correctly classifies xt ; otherwise, pt\\nj +1 = pt\\nj.   \\nBecause pt\\nj+1  should be probabilities, there is a normalization where we divide pt\\nj+1 by  𝑡 pt\\nj+1 , so that \\nthey sum up to 1. This has the effect that the probability of a correctly classified instance is decreased, \\nand the probability of a misclassified instance increases. Then a new sample of the same size is drawn \\nfrom the original sample according to these modified probabilities, pt\\nj+1 with replacement, and is used to \\ntrain dj+1. \\n  \\nThis has the effect that dj+1 focuses more on instances misclassified by dj ; that is why the base-learners \\nare chosen to be simple and not accurate, since otherwise the next training sample would contain only \\na few outlier and noisy instances repeated many times over. For example, with decision trees, decision \\nstumps, which are trees grown only one or two levels, are used. So it is clear that these would have bias \\nbut the decrease in variance is larger and the overall error decreases. An algorithm like the linear \\ndiscriminant has low variance, and we cannot gain by AdaBoosting linear discriminants. \\n. \\n3.5.2 Stacking - Stacked Generalization \\nStacked generalization is a technique proposed by Wolpert (1992) that extends voting in that \\nthe way the output of the base-learners is combined need not be linear but is learned through a \\ncombiner system, f (·|Φ), which is another learner, whose parameters Φ are also trained. (see the \\nbelow given figure)'),\n",

We cannot train the combiner function on the training data because the base-learners \\nmay be memorizing the training set; the combiner system should actually learn how the baselearners \\nmake errors. Stacking is a means of estimating and correcting for the biases of the base-learners. \\nTherefore, the combiner should be trained on data unused in training the base-learners. \\n \\nIf f (·|w1, . . . , wL) is a linear model with constraints, wi ≥ 0,  𝑗Wj = 1, the optimal weights can be found \\nby constrained regression, but of course we do not need to enforce this; in stacking, there is no \\nrestriction on the combiner function and unlike voting, f (·) can be nonlinear. For example, it may be \\nimplemented as a multilayer perceptron with Φ its connection weights. \\n \\nThe outputs of the base-learners dj define a new L-dimensional space in which the output \\ndiscriminant/regression function is learned by the combiner function. \\n \\nIn stacked generalization, we would like the base-learners to be as different as possible so that they will \\ncomplement each other, and, for this, it is best if they are based on different learning algorithms. If we \\nare combining classifiers that can generate continuous outputs, for example, posterior probabilities, it is \\nbetter that they be the combined rather than hard decisions. \\nWhen we compare a trained combiner as we have in stacking, with a fixed rule such as in \\nvoting, we see that both have their advantages: A trained rule is more flexible and may have less bias, \\nbut adds extra parameters, risks introducing variance, and needs extra time and data for training. Note \\nalso that there is no need to normalize classifier outputs before stacking. \\n \\n3.6 Probabilistic Learning \\nIn machine learning, a probabilistic classifier is a classifier that is able to predict, given an \\nobservation of an input, a probability distribution over a set of classes, rather than only outputting the \\nmost likely class that the observation should belong to. Probabilistic classifiers provide classification \\nthat can be useful in its own right or when combining classifiers into ensembles. \\n \\nOne criticism that is often made of neural networks—especially the MLP—is that it is not clear exactly \\nwhat it is doing: while we can go and have a look at the activations of the neurons and the weights, they \\ndon’t tell us much.'),\n",

This requires \\nunsupervised learning,  Suppose that the different classes each come from their own Gaussian \\ndistribution. This is known as multi-modal data, since there is one distribution (mode) for each different \\nclass. We can’t fit one Gaussian to the data, because it doesn’t look Gaussian overall. \\n \\nThere is, however, something we can do. If we know how many classes there are in the data, \\nthen we can try to estimate the parameters for that many Gaussians, all at once. If we don’t know, then \\nwe can try different numbers and see which one works best. We will talk about this issue more for a \\ndifferent method (the k-means algorithm) in Unit 2. It is perfectly possible to use any other probability \\ndistribution instead of a Gaussian, but Gaussians are by far the most common choice. Then the output \\nfor any particular datapoint that is input to the algorithm will be the sum of the values expected by all \\nof the M Gaussians: \\n \\n \\nwhere _(x ; μm,  𝑚) is a Gaussian function with mean μm and covariance matrix  𝑚, and the  αm are \\nweights with the constraint that  \\n𝛼𝑚 \\n𝑀\\n𝑚=1\\n =1. \\n \\nThe given figures 4 shows two examples, where the data (shown by the histograms) comes from two \\ndifferent Gaussians, and the model is computed as a sum or mixture of the two Gaussians together.  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 4: Histograms of training data from a mixture of two Gaussians and two fitted models, shown as \\nthe line plot.

In fact, it is \\ncommon to compute the log likelihood and then to maximise that; it is guaranteed to be negative, since \\nprobabilities are all less than 1, and the logarithm spreads out the values, making the optimisation more \\neffective. The algorithm that is used is an example of a very general one known as the expectation-\\nmaximisation (or more compactly, EM) algorithm. \\n \\n3.8 The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) Algorithm \\nThe basic idea of the EM algorithm is that sometimes it is easier to add extra variables that are \\nnot actually known (called hidden or latent variables) and then to maximise the function over those \\nvariables. This might seem to be making a problem much more complicated than it needs to be, but it \\nturns out for many problems that it makes finding the solution significantly easier. \\nIn order to see how it works, we will consider the simplest interesting case of the Gaussian \\nmixture model: a combination of just two Gaussian mixtures. The assumption now is that sample from \\nthat Gaussian. If the probability of picking Gaussian one is p, then the entire model looks like this \\n(where N(μ, σ2) specifies a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ): \\n \\n \\n \\nIf the probability distribution of p is written as π, then the probability density is: \\n \\n \\n \\nFinding the maximum likelihood solution (actually the maximum log likelihood) to this problem \\nis then a case of computing the sum of the logarithm of Equation  over all of the training data, and \\ndifferentiating it, which would be rather difficult. Fortunately, there is a way around it. The key insight \\nthat we need is that if we knew which of the two Gaussian components the datapoint came from, then \\nthe computation would be easy. The mean and standard deviation for each component could be \\ncomputed from the datapoints that belong to that component, and there would not be a problem. \\nAlthough we don’t know which component each datapoint came from, we can pretend we do, by \\nintroducing a new variable f. If f = 0 then the data came from Gaussian one, if f = 1 then it came from \\nGaussian two. \\n \\nThis is the typical initial step of an EM algorithm: adding latent variables. Now we just need to \\nwork out how to optimise over them. This is the time when the reason for the algorithm being called \\nexpectation-maximisation becomes clear.We don’t know much about variable f (hardly surprising, since \\nwe invented it), but we can compute its expectation (that is, the value that we ‘expect’ to see, which is \\nthe mean average) from the data: \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere D denotes the data.

Then this estimate of the \\nexpectation is maximised over the model parameters (the parameters of the two Gaussians and the \\nmixing parameter π), the M-step. This requires differentiating the expectation with respect to each of \\nthe model parameters. These two steps are simply iterated until the algorithm converges. Note that the \\nestimate never gets any smaller, and it turns out that EM algorithms are guaranteed to reach a local \\nmaxima. To see how this looks for the two-component Gaussian mixture, we’ll take a closer look at the \\nalgorithm: \\n \\n \\nThe trick with applying EM algorithms to problems is in identifying the correct latent variables \\nto include, and then simply working through the steps. They are very powerful methods for a wide \\nvariety of statistical learning problems. We are now going to turn our attention to something much \\nsimpler, which is how we can use information about nearby datapoints to decide on classification \\noutput. For this we don’t use a model of the data at all, but directly use the data that is available. \\n \\n3.9 Information Criteria \\nwe introduced the idea of a validation set, or using cross-validation if there was not enough \\ndata. However, this replaces data with computation time, as many models are trained on different \\ndatasets. \\n \\nAn alternative idea is to identify some measure that tells us about how well we can expect this \\ntrained model to perform. Probabilistic model selection (or “information criteria”) provides an \\nanalytical technique for scoring and choosing among candidate models. Models are scored both on \\ntheir performance on the training dataset and based on the complexity of the model.There are two \\nsuch information criteria that are commonly used: \\n \\n \\n \\nIn these equations, k is the number of parameters in the model, N is the number of training \\nexamples, and L is the best (largest) likelihood of the model.

It is unlikely that you will know the \\ndance moves for the particular song that is playing, so you will probably try to work out what to do by \\nlooking at what the people close to you are doing. The first thing you could do would be just to pick the \\nperson closest to you and copy them. However, since most of the people who are in the nightclub are \\nalso unlikely to know all the moves, you might decide to look at a few more people and do what most of \\nthem are doing. This is pretty much exactly the idea behind nearest neighbour methods: if we don’t \\nhave a model that describes the data, then the best thing to do is to look at similar data and choose to \\nbe in the same class as them. \\n \\nWe have the datapoints positioned within input space, so we just need to work out which of the \\ntraining data are close to it. This requires computing the distance to each datapoint in the training set, \\nwhich is relatively expensive: if we are in normal Euclidean space, then we have to compute d \\nsubtractions and d squarings (we can ignore the square root since we only want to know which points \\nare the closest, not the actual distance) and this has to be done O(N2) times. We can then identify the k \\nnearest neighbours to the test point, and then set the class of the test point to be the most common \\none out of those for the nearest neighbours. The choice of k is not trivial. Make it too small and nearest \\nneighbour methods are sensitive to noise, too large and the accuracy reduces as points that are too far \\naway are considered. Some possible effects of changing the size of k on the decision boundary are \\nshown in below Figure 5. \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 5: The nearest neighbours decision boundary with left: one neighbour and right: \\ntwo neighbours. \\n \\nThis method suffers from the curse of dimensionality.

However, more importantly, as the number of dimensions increases, so the distance to other \\ndatapoints tends to increase. In addition, they can be far away in a variety of different directions—there \\nmight be points that are relatively close in some dimensions, but a long way in others.

Fortunately, as with many problems in computer science, designing an \\nefficient data structure can reduce the computational overhead a lot. For the problem of finding \\nnearest neighbours the data structure of choice is the KD-Tree. It has been around since the late 1970s, \\nwhen it was devised by Friedman and Bentley, and it reduces the cost of finding a nearest neighbour to \\nO(log N) for O(N) storage. The construction of the tree is O(N log2 N), with much of the computational \\ncost being in the computation of the median, which with a naïve algorithm requires a sort and is \\ntherefore O(N log N), or can be computed with a randomised algorithm in O(N) time. \\n \\nThe idea behind the KD-tree is very simple. You create a binary tree by choosing one dimension \\nat a time to split into two, and placing the line through the median of the point coordinates of that \\ndimension. The points themselves end up as leaves of the tree. Making the tree follows pretty much the \\nsame steps as usual for constructing a binary tree: we identify a place to split into two choices, left and \\nright, and then carry on down the tree. This makes it natural to write the algorithm recursively. The \\nchoice of what to split and where is what makes the KD-tree special. Just one dimension is split in each \\nstep, and the position of the split is found by computing the median of the points that are to be split in \\nthat one dimension, and putting the line there.

However, it is not the only option, nor is it necessarily the most \\nuseful. In this section we will look at the underlying idea behind distance calculations and possible \\nalternatives. \\n \\nIf I were to ask you to find the distance between my house and the nearest shop, then your first \\nguess might involve taking a map of my town, locating my house and the shop, and using a ruler to \\nmeasure the distance between them. By careful application of the map scale you can now tell me how \\nfar it is. However, when I set out to buy some milk I’m liable to find that I have to walk rather further \\nthan you’ve told me, since the direct line that you measured would involve walking through (or over) \\nseveral houses, and some serious fence-scaling. Your ‘as the crow flies’ distance is the shortest possible \\npath, and it is the straight-line, or Euclidean, distance. You can measure it on the map by just using a \\nruler, but it essentially consists of measuring the distance in one direction (we’ll call it \\nnorth-south) and then the distance in another direction that is perpendicular to the first (let’s call it \\neast-west) and then squaring them, adding them together, and then taking the square root of that. \\nWriting that out, the Euclidean distance that we are all used to is: \\n \\n \\nwhere (x1, y1) is the location of my house in some coordinate system (say by using a GPS tracker) and \\n(x2, y2) is the location of the shop. \\n \\nIf I told you that my town was laid out on a grid block system, as is common in towns that were \\nbuilt in the interval between the invention of the motor car and the invention of innovative town \\nplanners, then you would probably use a different measure. You would measure the distance between \\nmy house and the shop in the ‘north-south’ direction and the distance in the ‘east-west’ direction, and \\nthen add the two distances together. This would correspond to the distance I actually had to walk. It is \\noften known as the city-block or Manhattan distance and looks like: \\n \\nThe point of this discussion is to show that there is more than one way to measure a distance, \\nand that they can provide radically different answers. These two different distances can be seen in \\nFigure 11. Mathematically, these distance measures are known as metrics. A metric function or norm \\ntakes two inputs and gives a scalar (the distance) back, which is positive, and 0 if and only if the two \\npoints are the same, symmetric (so that the distance \\nto the shop is the same as the distance back), and obeys the triangle inequality, which says that the \\ndistance from a to b plus the distance from b to c should not be less than the direct distance from a to c.'),\n",

In fact, these two measures are both instances of a class of metrics that \\nwork in any number of dimensions. The general measure is the Minkowski metric and it is written as: \\n \\n \\nIf we put k = 1 then we get the city-block distance (Equation (7.12)), and k = 2 gives the \\nEuclidean distance (Equation (7.11)). Thus, you might possibly see the Euclidean metric written as the L2 \\nnorm and the city-block distance as the L1 norm. These norms have another interesting feature. \\nRemember that we can define different averages of a set of numbers. If we define the average as the \\npoint that minimises the sum of the distance to every datapoint, then it turns out that the mean \\nminimises the Euclidean distance (the sum-of-squares distance), and the median minimises the L1 \\nmetric. \\n \\nThere are plenty of other possible metrics to choose, depending upon the dataspace. We \\ngenerally assume that the space is flat (if it isn’t, then none of these techniques work, and we don’t \\nwant to worry about that). However, it can still be beneficial to look at other metrics. Suppose that we \\nwant our classifier to be able to recognise images, for example of faces. We take a set of digital photos \\nof faces and use the pixel values as features. Then we use the nearest neighbour algorithm that we’ve \\njust seen to identify each face. Even if we ensure that all of the photos are taken fully face-on, there are \\nstill a few things that will get in the way of this method. One is that slight variations in the angle of the \\nhead (or the camera) could make a difference; another is that different distances between the face and \\nthe camera (scaling) will change the results; and another is that different lighting conditions will make a \\ndifference. We can try to fix all of these things in preprocessing, but there is also another alternative: \\nuse a different metric that is invariant to these changes, i.e., it does not vary as they do. The idea of \\ninvariant metrics is to find measures that ignore changes that you don’t want. So if you want to be able \\nto rotate shapes around and still recognize them, you need a metric that is invariant to rotation. \\n \\nA common invariant metric in use for images is the tangent distance, which is an approximation \\nto the Taylor expansion in first derivatives, and works very well for small rotations and scalings; for \\nexample, it was used to halve the final error rate on nearest neighbor classification of a set of \\nhandwritten letters. Invariant metrics are an interesting topic for further study, and there is a reference \\nfor them in the Further Reading section if you are interested.'),\n",

Introduction \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConsider building a learning robot. The robot, or agent, has a set of sensors to observe the state of \\nits environment, and a set of actions it can perform to alter this state.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIts task is to learn a control strategy, or policy, for choosing actions that achieve its goals.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe goals of the agent can be defined by a reward function that assigns a numerical value to each \\ndistinct action the agent may take from each distinct state.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThis reward function may be built into the robot, or known only to an external teacher who \\nprovides the reward value for each action performed by the robot.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe task of the robot is to perform sequences of actions, observe their consequences, and learn a \\ncontrol policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe control policy is one that, from any initial state, chooses actions that maximize the reward \\naccumulated over time by the agent.  \\nExample:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA mobile robot may have sensors such as a camera and sonars, and actions such as \"move \\nforward\" and \"turn.\"  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe robot may have a goal of docking onto its battery charger whenever its battery level is low.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe goal of docking to the battery charger can be captured by assigning a positive reward (Eg., \\n+100) to state-action transitions that immediately result in a connection to the charger and a \\nreward of zero to every other state-action transition.  \\n \\nReinforcement Learning Problem  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAn agent interacting with its environment.

Delayed reward: The task of the agent is to learn a target function 𝜋 that maps from the current state \\ns to the optimal action a = 𝜋 (s). In reinforcement learning, training information is not available in (s, 𝜋 \\n(s)). Instead, the trainer provides only a sequence of immediate reward values as the agent executes its \\nsequence of actions. The agent, therefore, faces the problem of temporal credit assignment: \\ndetermining which of the actions in its sequence are to be credited with producing the eventual \\nrewards.  \\n \\n2. Exploration: In reinforcement learning, the agent influences the distribution of training examples by \\nthe action sequence it chooses. This raises the question of which experimentation strategy produces \\nmost effective learning. The learner faces a trade-off in choosing whether to favor exploration of \\nunknown states and actions, or exploitation of states and actions that it has already learned will yield \\nhigh reward.  \\n \\n3. Partially observable states: The agent's sensors can perceive the entire state of the environment at \\neach time step, in many practical situations sensors provide only partial information. In such cases, the \\nagent needs to consider its previous observations together with its current sensor data when choosing \\nactions, and the best policy may be one that chooses actions specifically to improve the observability of \\nthe environment.  \\n \\n4. Life-long learning: Robot requires to learn several related tasks within the same environment, using \\nthe same sensors. For example, a mobile robot may need to learn how to dock on its battery charger, \\nhow to navigate through narrow corridors, and how to pick up output from laser printers.

Motivation \\nGenetic algorithms (GAS) provide a learning method motivated by an analogy to biological \\nevolution. Rather than search from general-to-specific hypotheses, or from simple-to-complex, GAS \\ngenerate successor hypotheses by repeatedly mutating and recombining parts of the best currently \\nknown hypotheses. At each step, a collection of hypotheses called the current population is updated by \\nreplacing some fraction of the population by offspring of the most fit current hypotheses. The process \\nforms a generate-and-test beam-search of hypotheses, in which variants of the best current hypotheses \\nare most likely to be considered next. The popularity of GAS is motivated by a number of factors \\nincluding: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nEvolution is known to be a successful, robust method for adaptation within biological systems. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGAS can search spaces of hypotheses containing complex interacting parts, where the impact of \\neach part on overall hypothesis fitness may be difficult to model. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGenetic algorithms are easily parallelized and can take advantage of the decreasing costs of \\npowerful computer hardware. \\n \\n9.2 Genetic Algorithms \\nThe problem addressed by GAS is to search a space of candidate hypotheses to identify the best \\nhypothesis. In GAS the \"best hypothesis\" is defined as the one that optimizes a predefined numerical \\nmeasure for the problem at hand, called b the hypothesis fitness. For example, if the learning task is the \\nproblem of approximating an unknown function given training examples of its input and output, then \\nfitness could be defined as the accuracy of the hypothesis over this training data. If the task is to learn a \\nstrategy for playing chess, fitness could be defined as the number of games won by the individual when \\nplaying against other individuals in the current population. \\nAlthough different implementations of genetic algorithms vary in their details, they typically share the \\nfollowing structure: The algorithm operates by iteratively updating a pool of hypotheses, called the \\npopulation. On each iteration, all members of the population are evaluated according to the fitness \\nfunction. A new population is then generated by probabilistically selecting the fit individuals from the \\ncurrent population. Some of these selected individuals are carried forward into the next generation \\npopulation intact. Others are used as the basis for creating new offspring individuals by applying genetic \\noperations such as crossover and mutation.'),\n",

At this point, a certain fraction m of these members are chosen at \\nrandom, and random mutations all performed to alter these members. \\n \\n \\nThis GA algorithm thus performs a randomized, parallel beam search for hypotheses that perform well \\naccording to the fitness function. In the following subsections, we describe in more detail the \\nrepresentation of hypotheses and genetic operators used in this algorithm. \\n \\nRepresenting Hypotheses \\nHypotheses in GAS are often represented by bit strings, so that they can be easily manipulated \\nby genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. The hypotheses represented by these bit strings \\ncan be quite complex. For example, sets of if-then rules can easily be represented in this way, by \\nchoosing an encoding of rules that allocates specific substrings for each rule precondition and \\npostcondition. \\nTo see how if-then rules can be encoded by bit strings, .first consider how we might use a bit \\nstring to describe a constraint on the value of a single attribute. To pick an example, consider the \\nattribute Outlook, which can take on any of the three values Sunny, Overcast, or Rain. One obvious way \\nto represent a constraint on Outlook is to use a bit string of length three, in which each bit position \\ncorresponds to one of its three possible values. Placing a 1 in some position indicates that the attribute \\nis allowed to take on the corresponding value. For example, the string 010 represents the constraint \\nthat Outlook must take on the second of these values, or Outlook = Overcast. Similarly, the string 011 \\nrepresents the more general constraint that allows two possible values, or (Outlook = Overcast v Rain). \\nNote 11 1 represents the most general possible constraint, indicating that we don\\'t care which of its \\npossible values the attribute takes on. \\nGiven this method for representing constraints on a single attribute, conjunctions of constraints \\non multiple attributes can easily be represented by concatenating the corresponding bit strings. For \\nexample, consider a second attribute, Wind, that can take on the value Strong or Weak. A rule \\nprecondition such as  \\n \\n(Outlook = Overcast ^Rain) A (Wind = Strong) \\n \\ncan then be represented by the following bit string of length five: \\n \\n    Outlook    Wind \\n01 1 \\n     10 \\n \\nRule postconditions (such as PlayTennis = yes) can be represented in a similar fashion. Thus, an entire \\nrule can be described by concatenating the bit strings describing the rule preconditions, together with \\nthe bit string describing the rule postcondition.

Note the bit string representing the rule contains a substring for each \\nattribute in the hypothesis space, even if that attribute is not constrained by the rule preconditions. This \\nyields a fixed length bit-string representation for rules, in which substrings at specific locations describe \\nconstraints on specific attributes. Given this representation for single rules, we can represent sets of \\nrules by similarly concatenating the bit string representations of the individual rules. \\n \\n \\nIn designing a bit string encoding for some hypothesis space, it is useful to arrange for every \\nsyntactically legal bit string to represent a well-defined hypothesis. To illustrate, note in the rule \\nencoding in the above paragraph the bit string 11 1 10 11 represents a rule whose postcondition does \\nnot constrain the target attribute PlayTennis. If we wish to avoid considering this hypothesis, we may \\nemploy a different encoding (e.g., allocate just one bit to the PlayTennis postcondition to indicate \\nwhether the value is Yes or No), alter the genetic operators so that they explicitly avoid constructing \\nsuch bit strings, or simply assign a very low fitness to such bit strings. \\n \\nIn some GAS, hypotheses are represented by symbolic descriptions rather than bit strings.  \\n \\nGenetic Operators \\nThe generation of successors in a GA is determined by a set of operators that recombine and \\nmutate selected members of the current population. These operators correspond to idealized versions \\nof the genetic operations found in biological evolution. The two most common operators are crossover \\nand mutation. \\nThe crossover operator produces two new offspring from two parent strings, by copying \\nselected bits from each parent. The bit at position i in each offspring is copied from the bit at position i \\nin one of the two parents. The choice of which parent contributes the bit for position i is determined by \\nan additional string called the crossover mask. To illustrate, consider the single-point crossover \\noperator at the top of Table Consider the topmost of the two offspring in this case. This offspring takes \\nits first five bits from the first parent and its remaining six bits from the second parent, because the \\ncrossover mask 11 11 1000000 specifies these choices for each of the bit positions. The second offspring \\nuses the same crossover mask, but switches the roles of the two parents. Therefore, it contains the bits \\nthat were not used by the first offspring. In single-point crossover, the crossover mask is always \\nconstructed so that it begins with a string containing n contiguous Is, followed by the necessary number \\nof 0s to complete the string. This results in offspring in which the first n bits are contributed by one \\nparent and the remaining bits by the second parent. Each time the single-point crossover operator is \\napplied the crossover point n is chosen at random, and the crossover mask is then created and applied.'),\n",

Put another way, the crossover mask is a string beginning with \\nno zeros, followed by a contiguous string of nl ones, followed by the necessary number of zeros to \\ncomplete the string. Each time the two-point crossover operator is applied, a mask is generated by \\nrandomly choosing the integers no and nl.  \\n \\nFitness Function and Selection \\nThe fitness function defines the criterion for ranking potential hypotheses and for \\nprobabilistically selecting them for inclusion in the next generation population. If the task is to learn \\nclassification rules, then the fitness function typically has a component that scores the classification \\naccuracy of the rule over a set of provided training examples. Often other criteria may be included as \\nwell, such as the complexity or generality of the rule. More generally, when the bit-string hypothesis is \\ninterpreted as a complex procedure (e.g., when the bit string represents a collection of if-then rules that \\nwill be chained together to control a robotic device), the fitness function may measure the overall \\nperformance of the resulting procedure rather than performance of individual rules. \\nIn our prototypical GA shown in above Table , the probability that a hypothesis will be selected is given \\nby the ratio of its fitness to the fitness of other members of the current population as seen in Equation \\nabove . This method is sometimes called fitness proportionate selection, or roulette wheel selection. \\nOther methods for using fitness to select hypotheses have also been proposed. For example, in \\ntournament selection, two hypotheses are first chosen at random from the current population. With \\nsome predefined probability p the more fit of these two is then selected, and with probability (1 - p) the \\nless fit hypothesis is selected. Tournament selection often yields a more diverse population than fitness \\nproportionate selection. In another method called rank selection, the hypotheses in the current \\npopulation are first sorted by fitness. The probability that a hypothesis will be selected is then \\nproportional to its rank in this sorted list, rather than its fitness.'),\n",

An Illustrative Example \\nA genetic algorithm can be viewed as a general optimization method that searches a large space \\nof candidate objects seeking one that performs best according to the fitness function. Although not \\nguaranteed to find an optimal object, GAS often succeed in finding an object with high fitness. GAS have \\nbeen applied to a number of optimization problems outside machine learning, including problems such \\nas circuit layout and job-shop scheduling. Within machine learning, they have been applied both to \\nfunction-approximation problems and to tasks such as choosing the network topology for artificial \\nneural network learning systems. \\nTo illustrate the use of GAS for concept learning, we briefly summarize the GABIL system \\ndescribed by DeJong et al. (1993). GABIL uses a GA to learn boolean concepts represented by a \\ndisjunctive set of propositional rules. In experiments over several concept learning problems, GABIL was \\nfound to be roughly comparable in generalization accuracy to other learning algorithms such as the \\ndecision tree learning algorithm C4.5 and the rule learning system AQ14. The learning tasks in this study \\nincluded both artificial learning tasks designed to explore the systems' generalization accuracy and the \\nreal world problem of breast cancer diagnosis. \\nThe specific instantiation of the GA algorithm in GABIL can be summarized as follows: \\nRepresentation. Each hypothesis in GABIL corresponds to a disjunctive set of propositional rules, \\nencoded as described in Section 9.2.1. In particular, the hypothesis space of rule preconditions consists \\nof a conjunction of constraints on a fixed set of attributes, as described in that earlier section. To \\nrepresent a set of rules, the bit-string representations of individual rules are concatenated. To illustrate, \\nconsider a hypothesis space in which rule preconditions are conjunctions of constraints over two \\nBoolean attributes, a1 and a2.The rule postcondition is described by a single bit that indicates the \\npredicted value of the target attribute c. Thus, the hypothesis consisting of the two rules \\n \\nIF al=T^a2=F THEN c=T; IF a2=T THEN c=F \\n \\n \\nwould be represented by the string \\n \\na1   a2   c   \\na1   a2   c \\n10  01  1 \\n11  01 0 \\n \\nNote the length of the bit string grows with the number of rules in the hypothesis. This variable bit-\\nstring length requires a slight modification to the crossover operator, as described below. \\n \\nGenetic operators. GABIL uses the standard mutation operator of  above Table in which a single \\nbit is chosen at random and replaced by its complement. The crossover operator that it uses is a fairly \\nstandard extension to the two-point crossover operator described in Table 9.2. In particular, to \\naccommodate the variable-length bit strings that encode rule sets, and to constrain the system so that \\ncrossover occurs only between like sections of the bit strings that encode rules, the following approach \\nis taken. To perform a crossover operation on two parents, two crossover points are first chosen at \\nrandom in the first parent string. Let dl (dz) denote the distance from the leftmost (rightmost) of these \\ntwo crossover points to the rule boundary immediately to its left. The crossover points in the second \\nparent are now randomly chosen, subject to the constraint that they must have the same dl and d2 \\nvalue. For example, if the two parent strings are\"),\n",

The first of \\nthese operators,  AddAlternative, generalizes the constraint on a specific attribute by changing a 0 to a \\n1 in the substring corresponding to the attribute. For example, if the constraint on an attribute is \\nrepresented by the string 10010, this operator might change it to 101 10. This operator was applied \\nwith probability .O1 to selected members of the population on each generation. The second operator, \\nDropcondition performs a more drastic generalization step, by replacing all bits for a particular attribute \\nby a 1. This operator corresponds to generalizing the rule by completely dropping the constraint on the \\nattribute, and was applied on each generation with probability .60. The authors report this revised \\nsystem achieved an average performance of 95.2% over the above set of synthetic learning tasks, \\ncompared to 92.1% for the basic GA algorithm. \\n \\nIn the above experiment, the two new operators were applied with the same probability to each \\nhypothesis in the population on each generation. In a second experiment, the bit-string representation \\nfor hypotheses was extended to include two bits that determine which of these operators may be \\napplied to the hypothesis. In this extended representation, the bit string for a typical rule set hypothesis \\nwould be  \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere the final two bits indicate in this case that the AddAlternative operator may be applied to this bit \\nstring, but that the Dropcondition operator may not. These two new bits define part of the search \\nstrategy used by the GA and are themselves altered and evolved using the same crossover and mutation \\noperators that operate on other bits in the string. While the authors report mixed results with this \\napproach (i.e., improved performance on some problems, decreased performance on others), it \\nprovides an interesting illustration of how GAS might in principle be used to evolve their own \\nhypothesis search methods. \\n \\n5.4 Hypothesis Space Search \\nAs illustrated above, GAS employ a randomized beam search method to seek a maximally fit hypothesis. \\nThis search is quite different from that of other learning methods we have considered in this book. To \\ncontrast the hypothesis space search of GAS with that of neural network BACKPROPAGATION, for \\nexample, the radiant descent search in BACKPROPAGATION moves smoothly from one hypothesis to a \\nnew hypothesis that is very similar. In contrast, the GA search can move much more abruptly, replacing \\na parent hypothesis by an offspring that may be radically different from the parent. Note the GA search \\nis therefore less likely to fall into the same kind of local minima that can plague gradient descent \\nmethods.  \\nOne practical difficulty in some GA applications is the problem of crowding. Crowding is a phenomenon \\nin which some individual that is more highly fit than others in the population quickly reproduces, so that \\ncopies of this individual and very similar individuals take over a large fraction of the population. The \\nnegative impact of crowding is that it reduces the diversity of the population, thereby slowing further \\nprogress by the GA. Several strategies have been explored for reducing crowding. One approach is to \\nalter the selection function, using criteria such as tournament selection or rank selection in place of \\nfitness proportionate roulette wheel selection. A related strategy is \"fitness sharing,\" in which the \\nmeasured fitness of an individual is reduced by the presence of other, similar individuals in the \\npopulation. A third approach is to restrict the kinds of individuals allowed to recombine to form \\noffspring. For example, by allowing only the most similar individuals to recombine, we can encourage'),\n",

A related \\napproach is to spatially distribute individuals and allow only nearby individuals to recombine. Many of \\nthese techniques are inspired by the analogy to biological evolution. \\n \\nPopulation Evolution and the Schema Theorem \\nIt is interesting to ask whether one can mathematically characterize the evolution over time of the \\npopulation within a GA. The schema theorem provides one such characterization. It is based on the \\nconcept of schemas, or patterns that describe sets of bit strings. To be precise, a schema is any string \\ncomposed of 0s, 1s, and *\\'s. Each schema represents the set of bit strings containing the indicated 0s \\nand 1s, with each “*” interpreted as a \"don\\'t care.\" For example, the schema 0*10 represents the set of \\nbit strings that includes exactly 0010 and 01 10. \\nAn individual bit string can be viewed as a representative of each of the different schemas that it \\nmatches. For example, the bit string 0010 can be thought of as a representative of 24 distinct schemas \\nincluding 00**, 0* 10, ****, etc. Similarly, a population of bit strings can be viewed in terms of the set \\nof schemas that it represents and the number of individuals associated with each of these schema.  \\nThe schema theorem characterizes the evolution of the population within a GA in terms of the number \\nof instances representing each schema. Let m(s, t) denote the number of instances of schema s in the \\npopulation at time t (i.e., during the tth generation). The schema theorem describes the expected value \\nof m(s,t+1) in terms of m(s, t) and other properties of the schema, population, and GA algorithm \\nparameters. \\nThe evolution of the population in the GA depends on the selection step, the recombination step, and \\nthe mutation step. Let us start by considering just the effect of the selection step. Let f (h) denote the \\nfitness of the individual bit string h and \\n\\uf028\\uf029t\\nf\\n\\uf04b\\ndenote the average fitness of all individuals in the \\npopulation at time t. Let n be the total number of individuals in the population. Let \\npt\\ns\\nh\\n\\uf0c7\\n\\uf065\\n, indicate \\nthat the individual h is both a representative of schema s and a member of the population at time t. \\nFinally, let \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\ndenote the average fitness of instances of schema s in the population at time t. \\nWe are interested in calculating the expected value of m(s,t+1), which we denote E[m(s,t+1)]. We can \\ncalculate E[m(s,t+1)] using the probability distribution for selection given in Equation, which can be \\nrestated using our current terminology as follows \\n \\nNow if we select one member for the new population according to this probability distribution, then the \\nprobability that we will select a representative of schema s is'),\n",

Therefore, the expected number of instances of s resulting from the n independent selection steps \\nthat create the entire new generation is just n times this probability. \\n \\n \\n \\nEquation states that the expected number of instances of schema s at generation t+1 is proportional to \\nthe average fitness \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\n of instances of this schema at time t , and inversely proportional to the \\naverage fitness \\n\\uf028\\uf029t\\nf\\n\\uf04b\\n of all members of the population at time t. Thus, we can expect schemas with \\nabove average fitness to be represented with increasing frequency on successive generations. If we \\nview the GA as performing a virtual parallel search through the space of possible schemas at the same \\ntime it performs its explicit parallel search through the space of individuals, then Equation indicates that \\nmore fit schemas will grow in influence over time.  \\nWhile the above analysis considered only the selection step of the GA, the crossover and mutation \\nsteps must be considered as well. The schema theorem considers only the possible negative influence \\nof these genetic operators (e.g., random mutation may decrease the number of representatives of s, \\nindependent of \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\n and considers only the case of single-point crossover. The full schema theorem \\nthus provides a lower bound on the expected frequency of schema s, as follows: \\n \\n \\nHere, pc is the probability that the single-point crossover operator will be applied \\nto an arbitrary individual, and pm, is the probability that an arbitrary bit of an arbitrary individual will be \\nmutated by the mutation operator. o(s) is the number of defined bits in schema s, where 0 and 1 are \\ndefined bits, but * is not. d(s) is the distance between the leftmost and rightmost defined bits in s. \\nFinally, l is the length of the individual bit strings in the population. Notice the leftmost term in Equation \\nis identical to the term from Equation and describes the effect of the selection step. The middle term \\ndescribes the effect of the single-point crossover operator-in particular, it describes the probability that \\nan arbitrary individual representing s will still represent s following application of this crossover \\noperator. The rightmost term describes the probability that an arbitrary individual representing schema \\ns will still represent schema s following application of the mutation operator. Note that the effects of \\nsingle-point crossover and mutation increase with the number of defined bits o(s) in the schema and \\nwith the distance d(s) between the defined bits. Thus, the schema theorem can be roughly interpreted \\nas stating that more fit schemas will tend to grow in influence, especially schemas containing a small \\nnumber of defined bits (i.e., containing a large number of *'s), and especially when these defined bits\"),\n",

Numerous more recent \\ntheoretical analyses have been proposed, including analyses based on Markov chain models and on \\nstatistical mechanics models. \\n \\n5.5 GENETIC PROGRAMMING \\nGenetic programming (GP) is a form of evolutionary computation in which the individuals in the \\nevolving population are computer programs rather than bit strings. The basic genetic programming \\napproach and presents a broad range of simple programs that can be successfully learned by GP.  \\n \\nRepresenting Programs \\nPrograms manipulated by a GP are typically represented by trees corresponding to the parse tree of the \\nprogram. Each function call is represented by a node in the tree, and the arguments to the function are \\ngiven by its descendant nodes. For example, below Figure illustrates this tree representation for the \\nfunction sin(x) + \\uf028\\n\\uf029\\ny\\nx \\uf02b\\n2\\n. To apply genetic programming to a particular domain, the user must define \\nthe primitive functions to be considered (e.g., sin, cos, \\n, +, -, exponential~), as well as the terminals \\n(e.g., x, y, constants such as 2). The genetic programming algorithm then uses an evolutionary search to \\nexplore the vast space of programs that can be described using these primitives. As in a genetic \\nalgorithm, the prototypical genetic programming algorithm maintains a population of individuals (in this \\ncase, program trees). On each iteration, it produces a new generation of individuals using selection, \\ncrossover, and mutation. The fitness of a given individual program in the population is typically \\ndetermined by executing the program on a set of training data. Crossover operations are performed by \\nreplacing a randomly chosen subtree of one parent program by a subtree from the other parent \\nprogram.'),\n",

In Koza\\'s formulation, the primitive functions used to compose programs \\nfor this task include the following three terminal arguments: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCS (current stack), which refers to the name of the top block on the stack, or F if there is no \\ncurrent stack. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTB (top correct block), which refers to the name of the topmost block on the stack, such that it \\nand those blocks beneath it are in the correct order. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNN (next necessary), which refers to the name of the next block needed above TB in the stack, \\nin order to spell the word \"universal,\" or F if no more blocks are needed.  \\n \\nAs can be seen, this particular choice of terminal arguments provides a natural representation for \\ndescribing programs for manipulating blocks for this task. Imagine, in contrast, the relative difficulty of \\nthe task if we were to instead define the terminal arguments to be the x and y coordinates of each \\nblock. \\nIn addition to these terminal arguments, the program language in this application included the \\nfollowing primitive functions:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(MS x) (move to stack), if block x is on the table, this operator moves x to the top of the stack \\nand returns the value T. Otherwise, it does nothing and returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(MT x) (move to table), if block x is somewhere in the stack, this moves the block at the top of \\nthe stack to the table and returns the value T. Otherwise, it returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(EQ x y) (equal), which returns T if x equals y, and returns F otherwise. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(NOT x), which returns T if x = F, and returns F if x = T. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(DU x y) (do until), which executes the expression x repeatedly until expressiony returns the \\nvalue T. \\n \\nTo allow the system to evaluate the fitness of any given program, Koza provided a set of 166 training \\nexample problems representing a broad variety of initial block configurations, including problems of \\ndiffering degrees of difficulty. The fitness of any given program was taken to be the number of these \\nexamples solved by the algorithm. The population was initialized to a set of 300 random programs. \\nAfter 10 generations, the system discovered the following program, which solves all 166 problems. \\n \\n(EQ (DU (MT CS)(NOT CS)) (DU (MS NN)(NOT NN)) ) \\n \\nNotice this program contains a sequence of two DU, or \"Do Until\" statements.

The \\nrole played by the top level EQ expression here is to provide a syntactically legal way to sequence these \\ntwo \"Do Until\" loops. \\nSomewhat surprisingly, after only a few generations, this GP was able to discover a program that solves \\nall 166 training problems. Of course the ability of the system to accomplish this depends strongly on the \\nprimitive arguments and functions provided, and on the set of training example cases used to evaluate \\nfitness. \\n \\nRemarks on Genetic Programming \\nAs illustrated in the above example, genetic programming extends genetic algorithms to the \\nevolution of complete computer programs. Despite the huge size of the hypothesis space it must \\nsearch, genetic programming has been demonstrated to produce intriguing results in a number of \\napplications. A comparison of GP to other methods for searching through the space of computer \\nprograms, such as hillclimbing and simulated annealing, is given by O\\'Reilly and Oppacher (1994). \\nWhile the above example of GP search is fairly simple, Koza et al. (1996) summarize the use of a GP in \\nseveral more complex tasks such as designing electronic filter circuits and classifying segments of \\nprotein molecules. The filter circuit design problem provides an example of a considerably more \\ncomplex problem. Here, programs are evolved that transform a simple fixed seed circuit into a final \\ncircuit design. The primitive functions used by the GP to construct its programs are functions that edit \\nthe seed circuit by inserting or deleting circuit components and wiring connections. The fitness of each \\nprogram is calculated by simulating the circuit it outputs (using the SPICE circuit simulator) to determine \\nhow closely this circuit meets the design specifications for the desired filter. More precisely, the fitness \\nscore is the sum of the magnitudes of errors between the desired and actual circuit output at 101 \\ndifferent input frequencies. In this case, a population of size 640,000 was maintained, with selection \\nproducing 10% of the successor population, crossover producing 89%, and mutation producing 1%. The \\nsystem was executed on a 64-node parallel processor. Within the first randomly generated population, \\nthe circuits produced were so unreasonable that the SPICE simulator could not even simulate the \\nbehavior of 98% of the circuits. The percentage of unsimulatable circuits dropped to 84.9% following \\nthe first generation, to 75.0% following the second generation, and to an average of 9.6% over \\nsucceeding generations. The fitness score of the best circuit in the initial population was 159, compared \\nto a score of 39 after 20 generations and a score of 0.8 after 137 generations. The best circuit, produced \\nafter 137 generations, exhibited performance very similar to the desired behavior. \\nIn most cases, the performance of genetic programming depends crucially on the choice of \\nrepresentation and on the choice of fitness function. For this reason, an active area of current research \\nis aimed at the automatic discovery and incorporation of subroutines that improve on the original set of \\nprimitive functions, thereby allowing the system to dynamically alter the primitives from which it \\nconstructs individuals. See, for example, Koza (1994). \\n \\n5.6 Models of Evolution and Learning \\nIn many natural systems, individual organisms learn to adapt significantly during their lifetime. \\nAt the same time, biological and social processes allow their species to adapt over a time frame of many \\ngenerations. One interesting question regarding evolutionary systems is \"What is the relationship \\nbetween learning during the lifetime of a single individual, and the longer time frame species-level \\nlearning afforded by evolution?\\' \\n \\nLamarckian Evolution \\nLarnarck was a scientist who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that evolution over many \\ngenerations was directly influenced by the experiences of individual organisms during their lifetime.

This is an \\nattractive conjecture, because it would presumably allow for more efficient evolutionary progress than \\na generate-and-test process (like that of GAS and GPs) that ignores the experience gained during an \\nindividual\\'s lifetime. Despite the attractiveness of this theory, current scientific evidence \\noverwhelmingly contradicts Lamarck\\'s model. The currently accepted view is that the genetic makeup \\nof an individual is, in fact, unaffected by the lifetime experience of one\\'s biological parents. Despite this \\napparent biological fact, recent computer studies have shown that Lamarckian processes can \\nsometimes improve the effectiveness of computerized genetic algorithms (see Grefenstette 1991; \\nAckley and Littman 1994; and Hart and Belew 1995). \\n \\nBaldwin Effect \\nAlthough Lamarckian evolution is not an accepted model of biological evolution, other mechanisms \\nhave been suggested by which individual learning can alter the course of evolution. One such \\nmechanism is called the Baldwin effect, after J. M. Baldwin (1896), who first suggested the idea. The \\nBaldwin effect is based on the following observations: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolutionary pressure to favor \\nindividuals with the capability to learn during their lifetime. For example, if a new predator \\nappears in the environment, then individuals capable of learning to avoid the predator will be \\nmore successful than individuals who cannot learn. In effect, the ability to learn allows an \\nindividual to perform a small local search during its lifetime to maximize its fitness. In contrast, \\nnonlearning individuals whose fitness is fully determined by their genetic makeup will operate \\nat a relative disadvantage. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThose individuals who are able to learn many traits will rely less strongly on their genetic code \\nto \"hard-wire\" traits. As a result, these individuals can support a more diverse gene pool, relying \\non individual learning to overcome the \"missing\" or \"not quite optimized\" traits in the genetic \\ncode. This more diverse gene pool can, in turn, support more rapid evolutionary adaptation. \\nThus, the ability of individuals to learn can have an indirect accelerating effect on the rate of \\nevolutionary adaptation for the entire population. \\n \\nTo illustrate, imagine some new change in the environment of some species, such as a new \\npredator. Such a change will selectively favor individuals capable of learning to avoid the predator. As \\nthe proportion of such self-improving individuals in the population grows, the population will be able to \\nsupport a more diverse gene pool, allowing evolutionary processes (even non-Lamarckian generate-\\nand-test processes) to adapt more rapidly. This accelerated adaptation may in turn enable standard \\nevolutionary processes to more quickly evolve a genetic (nonlearned) trait to avoid the predator (e.g., \\nan instinctive fear of this animal). Thus, the Baldwin effect provides an indirect mechanism for \\nindividual learning to positively impact the rate of evolutionary progress. By increasing survivability and \\ngenetic diversity of the species, individual learning supports more rapid evolutionary progress, thereby \\nincreasing the chance that the species will evolve genetic, nonlearned traits that better fit the new \\nenvironment.  \\nThere have been several attempts to develop computational models to study the Baldwin \\neffect. For example, Hinton and Nowlan (1987) experimented with evolving a population of simple \\nneural networks, in which some network weights were fixed during the individual network \"lifetime,\" \\nwhile others were trainable. The genetic makeup of the individual determined which weights were'),\n",

In their experiments, when no individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation failed to improve its fitness over time. However, when individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation quickly improved its fitness. During early generations of evolution the population contained \\na greater proportion of individuals with many trainable weights. However, as evolution proceeded, the \\nnumber of fixed, correct network weights tended to increase, as the population evolved toward \\ngenetically given weight values and toward less dependence on individual learning of weights. \\nAdditional computational studies of the Baldwin effect have been reported by Belew (1990), Harvey \\n(1993), and French and Messinger (1994). An excellent overview of this topic can be found in Mitchell \\n(1996). A special issue of the journal Evolutionary Computation on this topic (Turney et al. 1997) \\ncontains several articles on the Baldwin effect. \\n \\n5.7 Parallelizing Genetic Algorithms \\nGAS are naturally suited to parallel implementation, and a number of approaches to \\nparallelization have been explored. Coarse grain approaches to parallelization subdivide the population \\ninto somewhat distinct groups of individuals, called demes. Each deme is assigned to a different \\ncomputational node, and a standard GA search is performed at each node. Communication and cross-\\nfertilization between demes occurs on a less frequent basis than within demes. Transfer between \\ndemes occurs by a migration process, in which individuals from one deme are copied or transferred to \\nother demes. This process is modeled after the kind of cross-fertilization that might occur between \\nphysically separated subpopulations of biological species. One benefit of such approaches is that it \\nreduces the crowding problem often encountered in nonparallel GAS, in which the system falls into a \\nlocal optimum due to the early appearance of a genotype that comes to dominate the entire \\npopulation. Examples of coarse-grained parallel GAS are described by Tanese (1989) and by Cohoon et \\nal. (1987). \\nIn contrast to coarse-grained parallel implementations of GAS, fine-grained implementations \\ntypically assign one processor per individual in the population. Recombination then takes place among \\nneighboring individuals. Several different types of neighborhoods have been proposed, ranging from \\nplanar grid to torus. Examples of such systems are described by Spiessens and Manderick (1991). An \\nedited collection of papers on parallel GAS is available in Stender (1993).'),\n",

This measure is based on the concept that how much \\nvariation in y ’s  stated by \\nyy\\ns  is explainable by \\nreg\\nSS\\n and how much unexplainable part is contained in \\nres\\nSS\\n.  The ratio \\ne /\\nr g\\nyy\\nSS\\ns  describes the proportion of variability that is explained by regression in relation \\nto the total variability of  y .

The term prediction of the value of study variable corresponds to knowing the value of  \\n( )\\nE y  (in \\ncase of average value) and value of y  (in case of actual value) for a given value of the explanatory variable. \\nWe consider both cases. \\nCase 1: Prediction of average value \\nUnder the linear regression model, \\n0\\n1\\n,\\ny\\nx\\n\\uf062\\n\\uf062\\n\\uf065\\n\\uf03d\\n\\uf02b\\n\\uf02b\\n the fitted model is \\n0\\n1\\ny\\nb\\nb x\\n\\uf03d\\n\\uf02b\\n where \\n0\\n1\\nand\\nb\\nb  are  the \\nOLS estimators of  \\n0\\n1\\nand\\n\\uf062\\n\\uf062 respectively.'),\n",

There are many situations\\nwhere however we are interested in input-output relationships, as in regression, but\\nthe output variable is discrete rather than continuous. In particular there are many\\nsituations where we have binary outcomes (it snows in Pittsburgh on a given day, or\\nit doesn’t; this squirrel carries plague, or it doesn’t; this loan will be paid back, or\\nit won’t; this person will get heart disease in the next ﬁve years, or they won’t). In\\naddition to the binary outcome, we have some input variables, which may or may\\nnot be continuous. How could we model and analyze such data?\\nWe could try to come up with a rule which guesses the binary output from the\\ninput variables. This is called classiﬁcation, and is an important topic in statistics\\nand machine learning. However, simply guessing “yes” or “no” is pretty crude —\\nespecially if there is no perfect rule. (Why should there be?) Something which takes\\nnoise into account, and doesn’t just give a binary answer, will often be useful. In\\nshort, we want probabilities — which means we need to ﬁt a stochastic model.\\nWhat would be nice, in fact, would be to have conditional distribution of the\\nresponse Y , given the input variables, Pr(Y |X). This would tell us about how pre-\\ncise our predictions are. If our model says that there’s a 51% chance of snow and it\\ndoesn’t snow, that’s better than if it had said there was a 99% chance of snow (though\\neven a 99% chance is not a sure thing). We have seen how to estimate conditional\\nprobabilities non-parametrically, and could do this using the kernels for discrete vari-\\nables from lecture 6. While there are a lot of merits to this approach, it does involve\\ncoming up with a model for the joint distribution of outputs Y and inputs X, which\\ncan be quite time-consuming.\\nLet’s pick one of the classes and call it “1” and the other “0”. (It doesn’t mat-\\nter which is which. Then Y becomes an indicator variable, and you can convince\\nyourself that Pr(Y = 1) = E[Y ]. Similarly, Pr(Y = 1|X = x) = E[Y |X = x].

LOGISTIC REGRESSION\\nThis helps us because by this point we know all about estimating conditional ex-\\npectations. The most straightforward thing for us to do at this point would be to\\npick out our favorite smoother and estimate the regression function for the indicator\\nvariable; this will be an estimate of the conditional probability function.\\nThere are two reasons not to just plunge ahead with that idea. One is that proba-\\nbilities must be between 0 and 1, but our smoothers will not necessarily respect that,\\neven if all the observed yi they get are either 0 or 1. The other is that we might be\\nbetter off making more use of the fact that we are trying to estimate probabilities, by\\nmore explicitly modeling the probability.\\nAssume that Pr(Y = 1|X = x) = p(x;θ), for some function p parameterized by\\nθ. parameterized function θ, and further assume that observations are independent\\nof each other. The the (conditional) likelihood function is\\nn\\n\\uffff\\ni=1\\nPr\\uffffY = yi|X = xi\\n\\uffff=\\nn\\n\\uffff\\ni=1\\np(xi;θ)yi (1 −p(xi;θ)1−yi )\\n(12.1)\\nRecall that in a sequence of Bernoulli trials y1,...yn, where there is a constant\\nprobability of success p, the likelihood is\\nn\\n\\uffff\\ni=1\\npyi (1 −p)1−yi\\n(12.2)\\nAs you learned in intro. stats, this likelihood is maximized when p = ˆp = n−1 \\uffffn\\ni=1 yi.\\nIf each trial had its own success probability pi, this likelihood becomes\\nn\\n\\uffff\\ni=1\\npyi\\ni (1 −pi)1−yi\\n(12.3)\\nWithout some constraints, estimating the “inhomogeneous Bernoulli” model by max-\\nimum likelihood doesn’t work; we’d get ˆpi = 1 when yi = 1, ˆpi = 0 when yi = 0, and\\nlearn nothing. If on the other hand we assume that the pi aren’t just arbitrary num-\\nbers but are linked together, those constraints give non-trivial parameter estimates,\\nand let us generalize. In the kind of model we are talking about, the constraint,\\npi = p(xi;θ), tells us that pi must be the same whenever xi is the same, and if p is a\\ncontinuous function, then similar values of xi must lead to similar values of pi. As-\\nsuming p is known (up to parameters), the likelihood is a function of θ, and we can\\nestimate θ by maximizing the likelihood. This lecture will be about this approach.\\n12.2\\nLogistic Regression\\nTo sum up: we have a binary output variable Y , and we want to model the condi-\\ntional probability Pr(Y = 1|X = x) as a function of x; any unknown parameters in\\nthe function are to be estimated by maximum likelihood.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION\\n225\\n1. The most obvious idea is to let p(x) be a linear function of x. Every increment\\nof a component of x would add or subtract so much to the probability. The\\nconceptual problem here is that p must be between 0 and 1, and linear func-\\ntions are unbounded. Moreover, in many situations we empirically see “dimin-\\nishing returns” — changing p by the same amount requires a bigger change in\\nx when p is already large (or small) than when p is close to 1/2. Linear models\\ncan’t do this.\\n2. The next most obvious idea is to let log p(x) be a linear function of x, so that\\nchanging an input variable multiplies the probability by a ﬁxed amount. The\\nproblem is that logarithms are unbounded in only one direction, and linear\\nfunctions are not.\\n3. Finally, the easiest modiﬁcation of log p which has an unbounded range is the\\nlogistic (or logit) transformation, log\\np\\n1−p . We can make this a linear func-\\ntion of x without fear of nonsensical results. (Of course the results could still\\nhappen to be wrong, but they’re not guaranteed to be wrong.)\\nThis last alternative is logistic regression.\\nFormally, the model logistic regression model is that\\nlog\\np(x)\\n1 −p(x) = β0 + x · β\\n(12.4)\\nSolving for p, this gives\\np(x; b,w) =\\neβ0+x·β\\n1 + eβ0+x·β =\\n1\\n1 + e−(β0+x·β)\\n(12.5)\\nNotice that the over-all speciﬁcation is a lot easier to grasp in terms of the transformed\\nprobability that in terms of the untransformed probability.1\\nTo minimize the mis-classiﬁcation rate, we should predict Y = 1 when p ≥0.5\\nand Y = 0 when p < 0.5. This means guessing 1 whenever β0 + x ·β is non-negative,\\nand 0 otherwise. So logistic regression gives us a linear classiﬁer. The decision\\nboundary separating the two predicted classes is the solution of β0 + x · β = 0,\\nwhich is a point if x is one dimensional, a line if it is two dimensional, etc. One can\\nshow (exercise!) that the distance from the decision boundary is β0/\\uffffβ\\uffff+x·β/\\uffffβ\\uffff.\\nLogistic regression not only says where the boundary between the classes is, but also\\nsays (via Eq. 12.5) that the class probabilities depend on distance from the boundary,\\nin a particular way, and that they go towards the extremes (0 and 1) more rapidly\\nwhen \\uffffβ\\uffffis larger. It’s these statements about probabilities which make logistic\\nregression more than just a classiﬁer. It makes stronger, more detailed predictions,\\nand can be ﬁt in a different way; but those strong predictions could be wrong.\\nUsing logistic regression to predict class probabilities is a modeling choice, just\\nlike it’s a modeling choice to predict quantitative variables with linear regression.\\n1Unless you’ve taken statistical mechanics, in which case you recognize that this is the Boltzmann\\ndistribution for a system with two states, which differ in energy by β0 + x · β.'),\n",

Classi-\\nﬁcation is a bit like having a contingency table with two columns (classes) and\\ninﬁnitely many rows (values of x). With a ﬁnite contingency table, we can es-\\ntimate the log-odds for each row empirically, by just taking counts in the table.\\nWith inﬁnitely many rows, we need some sort of interpolation scheme; logistic\\nregression is linear interpolation for the log-odds.\\n3. It’s closely related to “exponential family” distributions, where the probabil-\\nity of some vector v is proportional to expβ0 + \\uffffm\\nj=1 fj(v)βj. If one of the\\ncomponents of v is binary, and the functions fj are all the identity function,\\nthen we get a logistic regression. Exponential families arise in many contexts\\nin statistical theory (and in physics!), so there are lots of problems which can\\nbe turned into logistic regression.\\n4. It often works surprisingly well as a classiﬁer. But, many simple techniques of-\\nten work surprisingly well as classiﬁers, and this doesn’t really testify to logistic\\nregression getting the probabilities right.\\n12.2.1\\nLikelihood Function for Logistic Regression\\nBecause logistic regression predicts probabilities, rather than just classes, we can ﬁt it\\nusing likelihood. For each training data-point, we have a vector of features, xi, and\\nan observed class, yi. The probability of that class was either p, if yi = 1, or 1 −p, if\\nyi = 0. The likelihood is then\\nL(β0,β) =\\nn\\n\\uffff\\ni=1\\np(xi)yi (1 −p(xi)1−yi\\n(12.6)'),\n",

NEWTON’S METHOD FOR NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION\\n229\\nCalculation of the likelihood now proceeds as before (only with more book-\\nkeeping), and so does maximum likelihood estimation.\\n12.3\\nNewton’s Method for Numerical Optimization\\nThere are a huge number of methods for numerical optimization; we can’t cover all\\nbases, and there is no magical method which will always work better than anything\\nelse. However, there are some methods which work very well on an awful lot of the\\nproblems which keep coming up, and it’s worth spending a moment to sketch how\\nthey work. One of the most ancient yet important of them is Newton’s method (alias\\n“Newton-Raphson”).\\nLet’s start with the simplest case of minimizing a function of one scalar variable,\\nsay f (β). We want to ﬁnd the location of the global minimum, β∗. We suppose that\\nf is smooth, and that β∗is a regular interior minimum, meaning that the derivative\\nat β∗is zero and the second derivative is positive. Near the minimum we could make\\na Taylor expansion:\\nf (β) ≈f (β∗) +\\n1\\n2(β −β∗)2 d 2 f\\ndβ2\\n\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\nβ=β∗\\n(12.14)\\n(We can see here that the second derivative has to be positive to ensure that f (β) >\\nf (β∗).) In words, f (β) is close to quadratic near the minimum.\\nNewton’s method uses this fact, and minimizes a quadratic approximation to the\\nfunction we are really interested in. (In other words, Newton’s method is to replace\\nthe problem we want to solve, with a problem which we can solve.) Guess an ini-\\ntial point β(0). If this is close to the minimum, we can take a second order Taylor\\nexpansion around β(0) and it will still be accurate:\\nf (β) ≈f (β(0)) + (β −β(0))\\nd f\\ndw\\n\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\nβ=β(0)\\n+\\n1\\n2\\n\\uffff\\nβ −β(0)\\uffff2 d 2 f\\ndw2\\n\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\nβ=β(0)\\n(12.15)\\nNow it’s easy to minimize the right-hand side of equation 12.15. Let’s abbreviate\\nthe derivatives, because they get tiresome to keep writing out:\\nd f\\ndw\\n\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\nβ=β(0) = f \\uffff(β(0)),\\nd 2 f\\ndw2\\n\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\nβ=β(0) = f \\uffff\\uffff(β(0)). We just take the derivative with respect to β, and set it equal\\nto zero at a point we’ll call β(1):\\n0\\n=\\nf \\uffff(β(0)) +\\n1\\n2 f \\uffff\\uffff(β(0))2(β(1) −β(0))\\n(12.16)\\nβ(1)\\n=\\nβ(0) −\\nf \\uffff(β(0))\\nf \\uffff\\uffff(β(0))\\n(12.17)\\nThe value β(1) should be a better guess at the minimum β∗than the initial one β(0)\\nwas. So if we use it to make a quadratic approximation to f , we’ll get a better ap-\\nproximation, and so we can iterate this procedure, minimizing one approximation'),\n",

The return\\nvalue includes the estmated minimum, the value of the function there, and some\\ndiagnostics — the derivative should be very small, the second derivative should be\\npositive, etc.\\nYou may have noticed some potential problems — what if we land on a point\\nwhere f \\uffff\\uffffis zero? What if f (β(n+1)) > f (β(n))? Etc.

Then the Newton update is\\nβ(n+1) = β(n) −H −1(β(n))∇f (β(n))\\n(12.19)\\nwhere ∇f is the gradient of f , its vector of partial derivatives [∂f /∂β1,∂f /∂β2,...∂f /∂βp],\\nand H is the Hessian of f , its matrix of second partial derivatives, Hi j = ∂2 f /∂βi∂βj.\\nCalculating H and ∇f isn’t usually very time-consuming, but taking the inverse\\nof H is, unless it happens to be a diagonal matrix. This leads to various quasi-Newton\\nmethods, which either approximate H by a diagonal matrix, or take a proper inverse\\nof H only rarely (maybe just once), and then try to update an estimate of H −1(β(n))\\nas β(n) changes.\\n12.3.2\\nIteratively Re-Weighted Least Squares\\nThis discussion of Newton’s method is quite general, and therefore abstract. In the\\nparticular case of logistic regression, we can make everything look much more “sta-\\ntistical”.\\nLogistic regression, after all, is a linear model for a transformation of the proba-\\nbility. Let’s call this transformation g:\\ng(p) ≡log\\np\\n1 −p\\n(12.20)\\nSo the model is\\ng(p) = β0 + x · β\\n(12.21)\\nand Y |X = x ∼Binom(1, g −1(β0 + x · β)). It seems that what we should want to\\ndo is take g(y) and regress it linearly on x. Of course, the variance of Y , according\\nto the model, is going to chance depending on x — it will be (g −1(β0 + x · β))(1 −\\ng −1(β0+x ·β)) — so we really ought to do a weighted linear regression, with weights\\ninversely proportional to that variance. Since writing β0 + x · β is getting annoying,\\nlet’s abbreviate it by µ (for “mean”), and let’s abbreviate that variance as V (µ).\\nThe problem is that y is either 0 or 1, so g(y) is either −∞or +∞. We will evade\\nthis by using Taylor expansion.\\ng(y) ≈g(µ) + (y −µ)g \\uffff(µ) ≡z\\n(12.22)\\nThe right hand side, z will be our effective response variable. To regress it, we need\\nits variance, which by propagation of error will be (g \\uffff(µ))2V (µ).\\n3optim actually is a wrapper for several different optimization methods; method=BFGS selects a\\nNewtonian method; BFGS is an acronym for the names of the algorithm’s inventors.'),\n",

LOGISTIC REGRESSION\\nNotice that both the weights and z depend on the parameters of our logistic\\nregression, through µ. So having done this once, we should really use the new pa-\\nrameters to update z and the weights, and do it again. Eventually, we come to a ﬁxed\\npoint, where the parameter estimates no longer change.\\nThe treatment above is rather heuristic4, but it turns out to be equivalent to using\\nNewton’s method, with the expected second derivative of the log likelihood, instead\\nof its actual value.5 Since, with a large number of observations, the observed sec-\\nond derivative should be close to the expected second derivative, this is only a small\\napproximation.\\n12.4\\nGeneralized Linear Models and Generalized Ad-\\nditive Models\\nLogistic regression is part of a broader family of generalized linear models (GLMs),\\nwhere the conditional distribution of the response falls in some parametric family,\\nand the parameters are set by the linear predictor. Ordinary, least-squares regression\\nis the case where response is Gaussian, with mean equal to the linear predictor, and\\nconstant variance. Logistic regression is the case where the response is binomial, with\\nn equal to the number of data-points with the given x (often but not always 1), and p\\nis given by Equation 12.5. Changing the relationship between the parameters and the\\nlinear predictor is called changing the link function. For computational reasons, the\\nlink function is actually the function you apply to the mean response to get back the\\nlinear predictor, rather than the other way around — (12.4) rather than (12.5). There\\nare thus other forms of binomial regression besides logistic regression.6 There is also\\nPoisson regression (appropriate when the data are counts without any upper limit),\\ngamma regression, etc.; we will say more about these in Chapter 13.\\nIn R, any standard GLM can be ﬁt using the (base) glm function, whose syn-\\ntax is very similar to that of lm. The major wrinkle is that, of course, you need\\nto specify the family of probability distributions to use, by the family option —\\nfamily=binomial defaults to logistic regression. (See help(glm) for the gory\\ndetails on how to do, say, probit regression.) All of these are ﬁt by the same sort of\\nnumerical likelihood maximization.\\nOne caution about using maximum likelihood to ﬁt logistic regression is that it\\ncan seem to work badly when the training data can be linearly separated. The reason\\nis that, to make the likelihood large, p(xi) should be large when yi = 1, and p should\\nbe small when yi = 0. If β0,β0 is a set of parameters which perfectly classiﬁes the\\ntraining data, then cβ0,cβ is too, for any c > 1, but in a logistic regression the second\\n4That is, mathematically incorrect.\\n5This takes a reasonable amount of algebra to show, so we’ll skip it. The key point however is the\\nfollowing. Take a single Bernoulli observation with success probability p. The log-likelihood is Y log p +\\n(1−Y )log1 −p. The ﬁrst derivative with respect to p is Y /p −(1−Y )/(1−p), and the second derivative\\nis −Y /p2 −(1 −Y )/(1 −p)2. Taking expectations of the second derivative gives −1/p −1/(1 −p) =\\n−1/p(1 −p). In other words, V (p) = −1/E\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff\\uffff. Using weights inversely proportional to the variance\\nthus turns out to be equivalent to dividing by the expected second derivative.\\n6My experience is that these tend to give similar error rates as classiﬁers, but have rather different\\nguesses about the underlying probabilities.'),\n",

First, we need to decide on an order of\\ntesting the input features. Next, given an order of testing the input features, we can build\\na decision tree by splitting the examples whenever we test an input feature.\\nLet’s take a look at the Jeeves training set again.\\nEach row is an example.\\nThere are\\n14 examples. For each example, we have ﬁve feature values: day, outlook, temperature,\\nhumidity, and wind. In fact, Day is not a useful feature since it’s diﬀerent for every example.\\nSo, we will focus on the other four input features. We have one target feature or label, which\\nis whether Bertie decided to play tennis or not.\\nThe decision tree is a powerful and ﬂexible model. Given a data set, we can generate many\\ndiﬀerent decision trees. Therefore, there are a few questions we need to think about when\\ndeciding which tree we should build.\\nFirst, diﬀerent orders of testing the input features will lead to diﬀerent decision trees. So,\\nwhich order should we use? The number of possible orders is quite large, so it is challenging\\nto ﬁnd the optimal order in the search space. Given this, we will use a greedy or myopic\\napproach. Instead of ﬁnding the optimal order of testing the features, we will make the\\nmyopic best choice at each step.\\nYou might be wondering, what is the diﬀerence between making the optimal choice versus\\nmaking the myopic best choice at each step? The main diﬀerence is that the optimal strategy\\nconsiders the future, whereas the myopic strategy only cares about the current step. To\\ngenerate an optimal tree, at each step, we need to think about how our feature choice at\\nthis step might aﬀect our choices in the future. On the contrary, the myopic strategy does\\nnot think about the future at all and only cares about ﬁnding the best feature to test at the\\ncurrent step.\\nNow, suppose that we have chosen an order of testing the features using the myopic strategy.\\nWe have another choice. Should we grow a full tree or should we stop growing the tree earlier?\\nRecall that I discussed over-ﬁtting previously. The full tree may over-ﬁt the training data,\\nso a smaller tree might be better since it might generalize better to unseen test data.\\nTo answer this question, we need a bias or an assumption that we make about which tree we\\nprefer. One possible assumption could be based on Occam’s razor principle, which says that\\nthe simplest model or hypothesis is probably the best. Based on Occam’s razor, we would\\nprefer a tree that is smaller than the full tree. This still leaves lots of options for us. For\\nexample, we can grow the tree until a certain depth, or we can grow the tree until it has a\\ncertain number of nodes.\\n4.2\\nGrow a full tree given an order of testing features\\nLet’s go through an example of constructing the full tree using the Jeeves training set.

This is an example of a noisy data set. With noisy data, even if we know the\\nvalues of all the input features, we are still unable to make a deterministic decision.\\nOne reason for having a noisy data set is that the decision may be inﬂuenced by\\nsome features that we do not observe. Perhaps, another factor not related to weather\\ninﬂuences Bertie’s decision, but we don’t know what that factor is.\\nWhat should we do when we run out of features to test? There are a few options.\\nOne option is to predict the majority class. In this case, the majority decision is No.\\nAnother option is to make a randomized decision. We can think of the three examples\\nas a probability distribution. There is a 1/3 probability of predicting Yes and a 2/3\\nprobability of predicting No. We will make the decision based on a random draw from\\nthe distribution. For this example, let’s use the majority decision.\\nc⃝Alice Gao 2021\\nv1.0\\nPage 12 of 36'),\n",

Given a data set,\\nwe can build many diﬀerent decision trees. Which tree should we build? One critical issue\\nin machine learning is over-ﬁtting. Over-ﬁtting often happens for a complex model, which\\ncaptures both the useful patterns in the data and the noise. One way to avoid over-ﬁtting is\\nto constrain our model to be a simple one. In our case, we will try to minimize the number\\nof features we have to test by learning a small and shallow tree.\\nIdeally, we would like to ﬁnd the optimal order of testing features, which will minimize the\\nsize of our tree. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the optimal order is too expensive computationally.\\nInstead, we will use a greedy and myopic approach.\\nThe myopic approach will make the best choice at each step without worrying about how\\nour current choice could aﬀect the potential choices in the future. More concretely, at each\\nstep, we will choose a feature that makes the biggest diﬀerence to the classiﬁcation, or a\\nfeature that helps us make a decision as quickly as possible.\\n5.2\\nIdentifying the most important feature\\nIn the previous section, we decided to choose a feature that helps us make a decision as soon\\nas possible, that is, a feature that reduces our uncertainty at much as possible.\\nTo measure the reduction in uncertainty, we will calculate the uncertainty in the examples\\nbefore testing the feature, and subtract the uncertainty in the examples after testing the\\nfeature. The diﬀerence measures the information content of the feature. Intuitively, testing\\nthe feature allows us to reduce our uncertainty and gain some useful information. We will\\nselect the feature that has the highest information content.\\nFinally, the only remaining question is: How do we measure the uncertainty in a set of\\nexamples? We will use a concept called entropy from information theory.\\nLet’s look at the deﬁnition of entropy. Consider a probability distribution over k outcomes:\\nc1 to ck. The probability of each outcome ci is P(ci).\\nGiven a distribution, we will calculate its entropy as follows: The entropy I is the summation\\nof several terms. For each outcome, multiply the probability of the outcome with the log\\nbase 2 of the probability of the outcome. We are using base 2 here because the information\\nis usually measured in bits. Finally, we’ll add all the terms together and negate the result,\\ngiving us a non-negative value. s\\nI(P(c1), . . . , P(c2)) = −\\nk\\nX\\ni=1\\nP(ci) log2(P(ci)).\\n(1)\\nc⃝Alice Gao 2021\\nv1.0\\nPage 16 of 36'),\n",

We considered two options:\\n• Allow multi-way splits.\\nThe tree becomes more complex than just if-then-else.\\nThe tree tends to be shallower.\\nThe expected information gain metric prefers a variable with a larger domain, because\\nwhen a variable has a larger domain we can split the data points into more sets, and\\nthere’s a higher chance to reduce entropy.\\n• Restrict to binary splits.\\nThe tree is simpler and more compact.\\nThe tree tends to be deeper.\\nExample:\\nAs an extreme example, pretend that Day is an additional input feature\\nin the Jeeves dataset, then the expected information gain for splitting on day must be\\nthe largest. Since we have one example for each day, and we can make a deterministic\\ndecision right away after splitting on day. However, it clearly does not make sense to\\nuse day as a feature, as the resulting tree does not generalize to any other data sets.\\nc⃝Alice Gao 2021\\nv1.0\\nPage 27 of 36'),\n",

In\\ncontrast, a neural network often does not work at all with a small data set, and it is extremely\\nprone to over-ﬁtting.\\nTherefore, even though decision trees have so many nice properties, over-ﬁtting is still a\\ncommon problem when we’re constructing a decision tree.\\nExample:\\nThe Jeeves data set has 14 data points, this is an extremely small data\\nset; we can still learn a reasonable decision tree for this data set.\\nDay\\nOutlook\\nTemp\\nHumidity\\nWind\\nTennis?\\n1\\nSunny\\nHot\\nHigh\\nWeak\\nNo\\n2\\nSunny\\nHot\\nHigh\\nStrong\\nNo\\n3\\nOvercast\\nHot\\nHigh\\nWeak\\nYes\\n4\\nRain\\nMild\\nHigh\\nWeak\\nYes\\n5\\nRain\\nCool\\nNormal\\nWeak\\nYes\\n6\\nRain\\nCool\\nNormal\\nStrong\\nNo\\n7\\nOvercast\\nCool\\nNormal\\nStrong\\nYes\\n8\\nSunny\\nMild\\nHigh\\nWeak\\nNo\\n9\\nSunny\\nCool\\nNormal\\nWeak\\nYes\\n10\\nRain\\nMild\\nNormal\\nWeak\\nYes\\n11\\nSunny\\nMild\\nNormal\\nStrong\\nYes\\n12\\nOvercast\\nMild\\nHigh\\nStrong\\nYes\\n13\\nOvercast\\nHot\\nNormal\\nWeak\\nYes\\n14\\nRain\\nMild\\nHigh\\nStrong\\nNo\\nDecision tree generated by the learner algorithm:\\nc⃝Alice Gao 2021\\nv1.0\\nPage 31 of 36'),\n",

A human information process sing system is composed of \\nneurons switching at speeds about a million times slower than computer gates. Yet, humans \\nare more efficient than computers at computationally complex tasks such as speech \\nunderstanding. Moreover, not only humans, but also even animals, can process visual \\ninformation better than the fastest computers. \\nArtificial neural systems, or neural networks (NN), are physical cellular systems, \\nwhich can acquire, store, and utilize experiential knowledge. The knowledge is in the form \\nof stable states or mappings embedded in networks that can be recalled in response to the \\npresentation cues. Neural network processing typically involves dealing with large-scale \\nproblems in terms of dimensionality, amount of data handled, and the volume of simulation \\nor neural hardware processing. This large-scale approach is both essential and typical for \\nreal-life applications. By keeping view of all these, the research community has made an \\neffort in designing and implementing the various neural network models for different \\napplications. Now let us formally define the basic idea of neural network: \\nDefinition: A neural network is a computing system made up of a number of \\nsimple, highly interconnected nodes or processing elements, which process information \\nby its dynamic state response to external inputs. \\n1.1.0 Humans and Computers \\nHuman beings are more intelligent than computers.  Computers could only do logical \\nthings well.  But in case of solving cross word puzzles, vision problem, controlling an arm to \\npick it up or something similar, that requires exceptionally complex techniques. Like these \\nproblems, human beings do better than computers. \\n \\nComputers are designed to carry out one instruction after another, extremely rapid, \\nwhereas our brains work with many slower units.  Whereas a computer can typically carry \\nout a few million operations every second, the units in the brain respond about ten per \\nsecond.  However, they work on many different things at once, which computer can’t do. \\n \\nThe computer is a high-speed, serial machine and is used as such, compared to the \\nslow, highly parallel nature of the brain.

For vision, or speech recognition, the problem is a highly parallel one, with many \\ndifferent and conflicting inputs, triggering many different and conflicting ideas and \\nmemories, and it is only the combining of all these different factors that allow us to perform \\nsuch feats, but then, our brains are able to operate in parallel easily and so we leave the \\ncomputers far behind. \\n \\nThe conclusion that we can reach from all of this is that the problems that we are \\ntrying to solve are immensely parallel ones. \\n1.2.0 History of artificial neural networks \\n• The field of neural networks is not new. The first formal definition of a synthetic \\nneuron model based on the highly simplified considerations of the biological model \\nproposed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943. The McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model \\nresembles what is known as a binary logic device.  \\n• The next major development, after the MP neuron model was proposed, occurred in \\n1949, when D.O. Hebb proposed a learning mechanism for the brain that become the \\nstarting point for artificial neural networks (ANN) learning (training) algorithms. He \\npostulated that as the brain learns, it changes its connectivity patterns. \\n• The idea of learning mechanism was first incorporated in ANN by E. Rosenblatt \\n1958. \\n• By introducing the least mean squares (LMS) learning algorithm, Widrow and Hoff \\ndeveloped in 1960 a model of a neuron that learned quickly and accurately. This \\nmodel was called ADALINE for ADAptive LInear NEuron. The applications of \\nADALINE and its extension to MADALINE (for Many ADALINES) include pattern \\nrecognition, weather forecasting, and adaptive controls. The monograph on learning \\nmachines by Nils Nilsson (1965) summarized the developments of that time. \\n• In 1969, research in the field of ANN suffered a serious setback. Minsky and Papert \\npublished a book on perceptrons in which they proved that single layer neural \\nnetworks have limitations in their abilities to process data, and are capable of any \\nmapping that is linearly separable. They pointed out, carefully applying mathematical \\ntechniques, that are logical Exclusive-OR (XOR) function could not be realized by \\nperceptrons. \\n• Further, Minsky and Papert argued that research into multi-layer neural networks \\nwould be unproductive.

Fortunately, \\nMinsky and Papert’s judgment has been disapproved; multi-layer perceptron networks \\ncan solve all nonlinear separable problems. \\n• Nevertheless, a few dedicated researchers such as Kohonen, Grossberg, Anderson and \\nHopfield continued their efforts. \\n• The study of learning in networks of threshold elements and of the mathematical \\ntheory of neural networks was pursued by Sun - Ichi – Amari (1972, 1977). Also \\nKunihiko Fukushima developed a class of neural network architectures known as \\nneocognitrons in 1980. \\n• There have been many impressive demonstrations of ANN capabilities: a network has \\nbeen trained to convert text to phonetic representations, which were then converted to \\nspeech by other means (Sejnowsky and Rosenberg 1987); other network can \\nrecognize handwritten characters (Burr 1987); and a neural network based image-\\ncompression system has been devised (Cottrell, Munro, and Zipser 1987). These all \\nuse the backpropagation network, perhaps the most successful of the current \\nalgorithms. Backpropagation, invented independently in three separate research \\nefforts (Werbos 1974, Parker 1982, and Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986) \\nprovides a systematic means for training multi-layer networks, thereby overcoming \\nlimitations presented by Minsky. \\n1.3.0 Characteristics of ANN \\nArtificial neural networks are biologically inspired; that is, they are composed of \\nelements that perform in a manner that is analogous to the most elementary functions of the \\nbiological neuron. The important characteristics of artificial neural networks are learning \\nfrom experience, generalize from previous examples to new ones, and abstract essential \\ncharacteristics from inputs containing irrelevant data. \\n1.3.1 Learning  \\nThe NNs learn by examples. Thus, NN architectures can be ‘trained’ with known \\nexamples of a problem before they are tested for their ‘inference’ capability on unknown \\ninstances of the problem. They can, therefore, identify new objects previously untrained. \\nANN can modify their behavior in response to their environment. Shown a set of inputs \\n(perhaps with desired outputs), they self-adjust to produce consistent responses. A wide \\nvariety of training algorithms has been discussed in later units.'),\n",

Researchers are explored different neural network architectures and used for various \\napplications.

The basic definition of artificial \\nneural networks as physical cellular networks that are able to acquire, store and utilize \\nexperimental knowledge has been related to the network’s capabilities and performance. The \\nsimplest network is a group of neurons are arranged in a layer. This configuration is known \\nas single layer neural networks.

Also, these is no \\nstatement in the proof of the perceptron learning algorithm that indicates how many steps will \\nbe required to train the network.  It is small consolation; to know that training will only take a \\nfinite number of steps if the time it takes is measured in geological units. \\n \\nFurther more, there is no proof that perceptron training algorithm is faster than simply \\ntrying all possible adjustment of the weights; in some cases this brute force approach may be \\nsuperior. \\n8.5.1 Limitations of perceptrons \\nThere are limitations to he capabilities of perceptrons however.  They will learn the \\nsolution, if there is a solution to be found.  First, the output values of a perceptron can take on \\nonly one of two values (True or False). Second, perceptrons can only classify linearly \\nseparable sets of vectors. If a straight line or plane can be drawn to separate the input vectors \\ninto their correct categories, the input vectors are linearly separable and the perceptron will \\nfind the solution. If the vectors are not linearly separable learning will never reach a point \\nwhere all vectors are classified properly. The most famous example of the perceptron's \\ninability to solve problems with linearly non-separable vectors is the boolean exclusive-OR \\nproblem. \\nConsider the case of the exclusive-or (XOR) problem.

L01: Intro to Machine Learning\\nPage 2\\n• In other words, we want a model that generalizes well to unseen data, which we can\\nmeasure, for example, by using an independent test set – while it sounds like this\\nshould be very straightforward, there are some pitfalls which we will discuss in the\\nnext lecture.\\n• Some of the evaluation metrics we can use to measure the performance on the test set\\nare the prediction accuracy and misclassiﬁcation error in the context of classiﬁcation\\nmodels – we say that a good model has a “high generalization accuracy” or “low\\ngeneralization error” (or, simply “good generalization performance”).\\n• The assumptions we generally make are the following:\\n– i.i.d. assumption: inputs are independent, and training and test examples are\\nidentically distributed (drawn from the same probability distribution).\\n– For some random model that has not been ﬁt to the training set, we expect both\\nthe training and test error to be equal.\\n– The training error or accuracy provides an (optimistically) biased estimate of the\\ngeneralization performance.\\nNow, overﬁtting and underﬁtting are two terms that we can use to diagnose a machine\\nlearning model based on the training and test set performance. I.e., a model that suﬀers\\nfrom underﬁtting does perform well on the test AND training set. In contrast, a model that\\noverﬁts (e.g., from ﬁtting the noise in the training dataset) can be usually recognized by a\\nhigh training set accuracy, but low test set accuracy. Intuitively, as a rule of thumb, the\\nlarger the hypothesis space a model has access to, the higher the risk of overﬁtting.\\nA more technical term for the size of the hypothesis space is the so-called capacity.

So, what does that mean? In\\ngeneral, we might say that “high variance” is proportional to overﬁtting, and “high bias”\\nis proportional to underﬁtting.

The Decomposition of the loss into bias and variance help us\\nunderstand learning algorithms, concepts are correlated to underﬁtting and overﬁtting.\\n• Thinking back of the ensemble lecture, the bias-variance decomposition and tradeoﬀ\\nhelp explain why ensemble methods might perform better than single models (i.e.,\\nwhy bagging reduces the variance, and why a boosting model has a lower bias than\\nindividual weak learners like decision tree stumps).\\n3In particular, in statistics, we evaluate the goodness of an estimator in relation to the true parameter\\nor function'),\n",

However,\\nfor simplicity, we will ignore the noise term in this lecture (some of the literature referenced\\nin later sections include the noise term if you are eager to learn more about variance-bias\\ndecomposition.).\\nBefore we introduce the bias-variance decomposition of the 0-1 loss for classiﬁcation, let us\\nstart with the decomposition of the squared loss as an easy warm-up exercise to get familiar\\nwith the overall concept.\\nThe previous section already listed the common formal deﬁnitions of bias and variance,\\nhowever, let us deﬁne them again for convenience:\\nBias(ˆθ) = E[ˆθ] −θ,\\nVar(ˆθ) = E[(E[ˆθ] −ˆθ)2].\\n(4)\\nRecall that in the context of these machine learning lecture (notes), we deﬁned\\n• the true or target function as y = f(x),\\n• the predicted target value as ˆy = ˆf(x) = h(x),\\n• and the squared loss as S = (y −ˆy)2. (I use S here because it will be easier to tell it\\napart from the E, which we use for the expectation in this lecture.)\\nNote that unless noted otherwise, the expectation is over training sets!\\nTo get started with the squared error loss decomposition into bias and variance, let use do\\nsome algebraic manipulation, i.e., adding and subtracting the expected value of ˆy and then\\nexpanding the expression using the quadratic formula (a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab):\\nS = (y −ˆy)2\\n(y −ˆy)2 = (y −E[ˆy] + E[ˆy] −ˆy)2\\n= (y −E[ˆy])2 + (E[ˆy] −y)2 + 2(y −E[ˆy])(E[ˆy] −ˆy).\\n(5)\\nNext, we just use the expectation on both sides, and we are already done:\\nE[S] = E[(y −ˆy)2]\\nE[(y −ˆy)2] = (y −E[ˆy])2 + E[(E[ˆy] −ˆy)2]\\n= [Bias]2 + Variance\\n(6)\\nYou may wonder what happened to the “2ab” term (2(y −E[ˆy])(E[ˆy] −ˆy)) when we used\\nthe expectation. It turns that it evaluates to zero and hence vanishes from the equation,\\nwhich can be shown as follows:\\nE[2(y −E[ˆy])(E[ˆy] −ˆy)] = 2E[(y −E[ˆy])(E[ˆy] −ˆy)]\\n= 2(y −E[ˆy])E[(E[ˆy] −ˆy)]\\n= 2(y −E[ˆy])(E[E[ˆy]] −E[ˆy])\\n= 2(y −E[ˆy])(E[ˆy] −E[ˆy])\\n= 0.\\n(7)'),\n",

To quote Pedro Domingos, a well-known machine learn-\\ning researcher and professor at University of Washington: “several authors have proposed\\nbias-variance decompositions related to zero-one loss (Kong & Dietterich, 1995; Breiman,\\n1996b; Kohavi & Wolpert, 1996; Tibshirani, 1996; Friedman, 1997). However, each of these\\ndecompositions has signiﬁcant shortcomings.”4. In fact, the paper this quote was taken from\\nmay oﬀer the most intuitive and general formulation at this point. However, we will ﬁrst,\\nfor simplicity, go over Kong & Dietterich formulation5 of the 0-1 loss decomposition, which\\nis the same as Domingos’s but excluding the noise term (for simplicity).\\nThe table below summarizes the relevant terms we used for the squared loss in relation to\\nthe 0-1 loss. Recall that the 0-1 loss, L, is 0 if a class label is predicted correctly, and one\\notherwise. The main prediction for the squared error loss is simply the average over the\\npredictions E[ˆy] (the expectation is over training sets), for the 0-1 loss Kong & Dietterich\\nand Domingos deﬁned it as the mode. I.e., if a model predicts the label one more than\\n50% of the time (considering all possible training sets), then the main prediction is 1, and\\n0 otherwise.\\nSquared Loss\\n0-1 Loss\\nSingle loss\\n(y −ˆy)2\\nL(y, ˆy)\\nExpected loss\\nE[(y −ˆy)2]\\nE[L(y, ˆy)]\\nMain prediction E[ˆy]\\nmean (average)\\nmode\\nBias2\\n(y −E[ˆy])2\\nL(y, E[ˆy])\\nVariance\\nE[(E[ˆy] −ˆy)2]\\nE[L(ˆy, E[ˆy])]\\n4Pedro Domingos. “A uniﬁed bias-variance decomposition”.

L01: Intro to Machine Learning\\nPage 8\\nHence, as result from using the mode to deﬁne the main prediction of the 0-1 loss, the bias\\nis 1 if the main prediction does not agree with the true label y, and 0 otherwise:\\nBias =\\n(\\n1 if y ̸= E[ˆy],\\n0 otherwise.\\n(8)\\nThe variance of the 0-1 loss is deﬁned as the probability that the predicted label does not\\nmatch the main prediction:\\nV ariance = P(ˆy ̸= E[ˆy]).\\n(9)\\nNext, let us take a look at what happens to the loss if the bias is 0. Given the general\\ndeﬁnition of the loss, loss = bias + variance, if the bias is 0, then we deﬁne the loss as the\\nvariance:\\nLoss = 0 + V ariance = Loss = P(ˆy ̸= y) = V ariance = P(ˆy ̸= E[ˆy]).\\n(10)\\nIn other words, if a model has zero bias, it’s loss is entirely deﬁned by the variance, which\\nis intuitive if we think of variance in the context of being proportional overﬁtting.\\nThe more surprising scenario is if the bias is equal to 1. If the bias is equal to 1, as explained\\nby Pedro Domingos, the increasing the variance can decrease the loss, which is an interesting\\nobservation. This can be seen by ﬁrst rewriting the 0-1 loss function as\\nLoss = P(ˆy ̸= y) = 1 −P(ˆy = y).\\n(11)\\n(Note that we have not done anything new, yet.) Now, if we look at the previous equation\\nof the bias, if the bias is 1, we have $ y ̸= E[{ˆy}]$.Ify is not equal to the main prediction,\\nbut y is also is equal to ˆy, then ˆy must be equal to the main prediction. Using the “inverse”\\n(“1 minus”), we can then write the loss as\\nLoss = P(ˆy ̸= y) = 1 −P(ˆy = y) = 1 −P(ˆy ̸= E[ˆy]).\\n(12)\\nSince the bias is 1, the loss is hence deﬁned as “loss = bias - variance” if the bias is 1 (or\\n“loss = 1 - variance”). This might be quite unintuitive at ﬁrst, but the explanations Kong,\\nDietterich, and Domingos oﬀer was that if a model has a very high bias such that it main\\nprediction is always wrong, increasing the variance can be beneﬁcial, since increasing the\\nvariance would push the decision boundary, which might lead to some correct predictions\\njust by chance then. In other words, for scenarios with high bias, increasing the variance\\ncan improve (decrease) the loss!\\n8.6\\nConclusion\\nIn this lecture, we decomposed the squared error loss into variance and bias terms and\\ndiscussed how these components relate to overﬁtting and underﬁtting. Then, we referred\\nto a bias-variance decomposition that Kong & Dietterich deﬁned for the 0-1 loss. Pedro\\nDomingos later generalized this further, including the noise term, which we did not discuss\\nin this lecture.

It has several advantages, including:\\n1. Ease of implementation: Gradient descent is relatively easy to implement, as it only requires\\nthe calculation of gradients and updates to the parameters. It does not require complex\\nmathematical techniques like linear algebra, eigenvalue decomposition, or matrix inversion.\\n2. Convergence guarantee: Gradient descent is guaranteed to converge to a minimum, under\\ncertain conditions such as the cost function being differentiable and having a unique global\\nminimum. The convergence speed can be controlled by the learning rate, which can be set\\nappropriately to achieve a good balance between convergence speed and accuracy.\\n3. Scalability: Gradient descent can be used for high-dimensional problems and can scale well\\nwith large amounts of data. In practice, the convergence of gradient descent can be accelerated\\nthrough techniques such as batch normalization, early stopping, or momentum.\\n4. Versatility: Gradient descent can be applied to a wide range of optimization problems,\\nincluding linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It can also be used for\\nnon-convex optimization problems, where multiple local minima may exist, although\\nconvergence to a good solution may be less certain in such cases.\\n37 / 39'),\n",

But the actual objective of this unit is to explain \\nsome performance measures of evaluating a machine learning algorithm on \\nthe basis of which we can say that one algorithm is better than the other. To \\ndo so, first, we have to build at least two machine learning algorithms so that \\nwe can compare their performance measures. In machine learning \\nterminology, performance measures are known as evaluation metrics. \\nHowever, before doing all this, first we have to define training and testing \\ndatasets and the same is done in Sec. 2.2. After that some evaluation metrics \\nare discussed in Secs. 2.3 and 2.4.                 \\nWhat we have discussed in this unit is summarised in Sec. 2.5. Self-\\nAssessment Questions (SAQs) have been given in some sections which are \\ngenerally based on the content discussed in that section. But to give you a \\ngood practice of what we have discussed in this unit, some more problems \\nbased on the entire unit are given in Sec. 2.6 under the heading Terminal \\nQuestions. Due to the reason mentioned in Sec. 1.1 of Unit 1 of this course, \\nsolutions of all the SAQs and Terminal Questions are given in Sec. 2.7.  \\nIn the next unit, you will study the OC curve and the area under the curve \\n(AUC) in detail.'),\n",

It \\nmeans you have a complete flow chart for every possible situation and clear-\\ncut instructions for each situation on what to do. The job of a computer is just \\nto follow a given set of rules and perform operations accordingly. The list of all \\nrules and operations in a logical sequence is prepared by a traditional \\ncomputer programmer. For example, if you want to obtain the mean of the \\nnumbers 3, 6, 7, 4 using R software, then it can be done as follows: \\n \\nNow, here, first of all, the four numbers 3, 6, 7, 4 are stored in a vector x1. \\nAfter that, we have applied the built-in function mean(). The programming of \\nmean() function is explicitly programmed in the R software, i.e., the system will \\nperform the operation Sum of all observations .\\nNumber of observations  So, hope this simple example \\nhas explained the meaning of explicitly programmed.  \\n \\n… (2.3) \\nIn this definition, the second important thing that you should know is the \\nmeaning of “ability to learn”. The learning part in machine learning algorithms \\nis dictated by the dataset, and the more data we have, the more the machine \\nlearning algorithm learns. So, the algorithm’s learning ability increases with \\nmore and more data we have to train the algorithm. So, the moral of the story'),\n",

      "Answer: **Version Spaces: A Concept in Machine Learning**\n",
      "\n",
      "Version spaces are a fundamental concept in machine learning, particularly in the field of inductive inference. They were introduced by Mitchell in 1982 as a way to represent the set of possible hypotheses that are consistent with a given set of training examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Definition:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The version space, denoted as V(H, D), is the subset of hypotheses from the hypothesis space H that are consistent with the training examples in D.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mathematical Representation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let H be the hypothesis space, D be the set of training examples, and V(H, D) be the version space. Then:\n",
      "\n",
      "V(H, D) = {h ∈ H | h(x) = c(x) ∀ x ∈ D}\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* h ∈ H: This means that h is a hypothesis in the hypothesis space H.\n",
      "* h(x) = c(x): This means that the hypothesis h correctly classifies the example x, where c(x) is the correct classification of x.\n",
      "* ∀ x ∈ D: This means that the hypothesis h must correctly classify all examples in the training set D.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Difference:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The key difference between the definitions of \"satisfies\" and \"consistent\" is that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* An example x satisfies a hypothesis h if h(x) = 1, regardless of whether x is a positive or negative example of the target concept.\n",
      "* An example x is consistent with a hypothesis h if h(x) = c(x), where c(x) is the correct classification of x.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we have a hypothesis space H that consists of two hypotheses: h1 and h2. The training set D contains two examples: x1 and x2. The correct classifications of x1 and x2 are c(x1) = 1 and c(x2) = 0, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "If h1(x1) = 1 and h1(x2) = 0, then h1 is consistent with the training set D, and h1 ∈ V(H, D).\n",
      "\n",
      "If h2(x1) = 0 and h2(x2) = 1, then h2 is not consistent with the training set D, and h2 ∉ V(H, D).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the version space V(H, D) contains only the hypothesis h1, which is consistent with the training set D.\n",

      "Answer: Decision Tree Learning Algorithm\n",
      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision Tree Learning is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a simple yet powerful algorithm that works by recursively partitioning the data into smaller subsets based on the input features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "A decision tree consists of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Root Node**: The topmost node in the tree, which represents the entire dataset.\n",
      "2. **Internal Nodes**: These nodes represent a feature or attribute of the data. Each internal node performs a Boolean test on the input feature.\n",
      "3. **Leaf Nodes**: These nodes represent the predicted class or target value.\n",
      "4. **Edges**: These are the connections between nodes, labeled with the values of the input feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Learning Algorithm**\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision tree learning algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choose a Root Node**: Select a feature or attribute to be the root node of the tree.\n",
      "2. **Split the Data**: Partition the data into subsets based on the root node feature. This is done by applying a Boolean test to the data.\n",
      "3. **Recursively Split**: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each subset of data, until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., all instances in a subset belong to the same class).\n",
      "4. **Create Leaf Nodes**: When a stopping criterion is met, create a leaf node with the predicted class or target value.\n",
      "5. **Prune the Tree**: Remove branches that do not contribute to the accuracy of the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Induction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision tree induction is the process of constructing a decision tree from a dataset. The goal is to create a tree that accurately classifies new, unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Induction Algorithm**\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision tree induction algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choose a Root Node**: Select a feature or attribute to be the root node of the tree.\n",
      "2. **Calculate the Gain**: Calculate the gain of each feature in the dataset. The gain is a measure of how well the feature splits the data.\n",
      "3. **Select the Best Feature**: Select the feature with the highest gain as the root node.\n",
      "4. **Split the Data**: Partition the data into subsets based on the root node feature.\n",
      "5. **Recursively Split**: Repeat steps 2-4 for each subset of data, until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision tree evaluation involves assessing the performance of a decision tree on a test dataset. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Advantages**\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision trees have several advantages, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Interpretability**: Decision trees are easy to interpret, as the tree structure provides a clear understanding of how the model makes predictions.\n",
      "* **Handling Missing Values**: Decision trees can handle missing values by ignoring the feature or using a default value.\n",
      "* **Handling Non-Normal Data**: Decision trees can handle non-normal data by using a non-parametric approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision Tree Disadvantages**\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision trees have several disadvantages, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Overfitting**: Decision trees can overfit the training data, resulting in poor performance on test data.\n",
      "* **Handling High-Dimensional Data**: Decision trees can struggle with high-dimensional data, as the number of features can lead to overfitting.\n",

      "Answer: **What is Gradient Descent?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the loss function of a model. It's a popular technique for finding the optimal parameters of a model by iteratively adjusting them based on the gradient of the loss function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Gradient Descent Works**\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of Gradient Descent is to find the minimum value of the loss function, which measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization**: Initialize the model's parameters (weights and biases) randomly.\n",
      "2. **Forward Pass**: Compute the model's predictions using the current parameters.\n",
      "3. **Compute Loss**: Calculate the loss function using the predictions and actual values.\n",
      "4. **Compute Gradient**: Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.\n",
      "5. **Update Parameters**: Update each parameter by subtracting a fraction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mathematical Representation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's denote the loss function as `L`, the model's parameters as `w` (weights) and `b` (biases), the learning rate as `α`, and the number of iterations as `t`. The update rule for each parameter `w_i` is:\n",
      "\n",
      "`w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) - α * ∂L/∂w_i`\n",
      "\n",
      "where `∂L/∂w_i` is the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to `w_i`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation of Symbols**\n",
      "\n",
      "* `L`: Loss function (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy)\n",
      "* `w`: Model's weights (parameters)\n",
      "* `b`: Model's biases (parameters)\n",
      "* `α`: Learning rate (step size)\n",
      "* `t`: Iteration number\n",
      "* `∂L/∂w_i`: Partial derivative of the loss function with respect to `w_i`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Gradient Descent**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main types of Gradient Descent:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Batch Gradient Descent**: Updates the parameters using the entire training dataset at each iteration.\n",
      "2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Updates the parameters using a single training example at each iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages and Disadvantages**\n",
      "\n",
      "Advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Simple to implement\n",
      "* Fast convergence\n",
      "* Can handle large datasets\n",
      "\n",
      "Disadvantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* May get stuck in local minima\n",
      "* Requires careful selection of learning rate and batch size\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradient Descent is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning that helps optimize model parameters to minimize the loss function. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for many machine learning applications.\n",
